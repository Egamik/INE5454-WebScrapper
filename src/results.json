            "It is as if Americans simply do not understand the purpose of taxes. (Or tarriffs). - If you paid some more in tax then you could get a fair, free scool system and a perfectly good, free health care system.\n\nThe absurd thing is that by paying those things over taxes the total cost for America would be much lower. - You could reduce nationwide health care costs with about 50% with no reduction in quantity or qualirty of the health care. - And children could get a proper education even with very poor parents or a struggeling single mother. So there would end up being more smart people in the USA. And you really, really need them these days.\n\nPaying more in tax would on the other hand reduce family costs for both education and health care. So on average this would be a benefit for all. Exept for the insurance companies which will go out of business. They are not needed when things are done this way.",
            "How much more than the legal minimum to stay out of Jail do you pay in taxes? I have to assume that since you have such a deep, rich appreciation of taxation, you'd never limit yourself just to what you HAD to pay. That's what THOSE IDIOTS who don't know how lucky they are to pay taxes do.\n\nSo how much more?"

The emoluments lawsuits that were filed during his first term took so long they ended up being rendered moot since he had already left office by the time they got to the Supreme Court. No doubt that's exactly what they're counting on happening again.\n\n>I've never fully understood why so few people seem to care about Trump's flagrant corruption. The Democrats only half-heartedly investigated it and certainly didn't bother to make it a campaign issue. Apparently, not selling the presidency to the highest bidder is just another one of those vaunted norms that was easily discarded, soon to be forgotten.

FIrst, 90% of counties voted slightly rightward than they historically have done. I guarantee Sheboygan county Wisconsin wasn't lost because of Palestine. What issue effects damned near everyone? Prices. Everyone buys shit, everyone sees it. Data point two: same phenomenon took down incumbents all over the world. It wasn't just us.",
            "He definitely does. But I have observed that his brand of politics isn't quite popular enough to win reliably, not without an assist. He got one in 2016 from Comey and Putin and won. He didn't get one in 2020 and he lost. He got one in 2024 in the form of post-pandemic inflation and he won.",

            "You can\u2019t force them to listen to a narrative anymore thanks to decentralized media - now you have to actually change shit. Trump changes shit and lies and tells people life is better for them, and it is for some people momentarily, and that story gets repeated enough people believe it. Dems have a two step problem, we suck at messaging and our party is captured by the traditional consulting firms that get paid by and have worked for mega corps. So they have no incentive to actually change things, and on top of that they suck at telling people what good things the party actually did. You have to actually change something significantly enough for everyone to feel or notice it, and then you have to explain to everyone what that was, not just the people already subscribed to traditional media who are already locked in to supporting their favorite candidates.",
            "But there's a difference between \"Inflation was the main reason we won\" and \"There's nothing we could have done to win this race because of inflation\". The later seems to be your stance. If it's not, then the other things that could have led to us winning are much more worth discussing than just the reality of inflation. \n\nAs far as why those things could have changed the outcome I'd say the race was ultimately decided by 1.6%. A pretty close election by historical standards. If we lost because of the incumbent inflation issue it's pretty reasonable to assume that we could overcome 1.6% by not running an incumbent. Something a primary would have given us.",

Had their been a primary where we selected someone not as unlikable and entrenched in the current things people are upset with Dems would have stood a much better chance to beat Trump.",

            "Hindsight is 20/20. It would have been smart, maybe. But who throws away the advantage of the incumbency? With a great record? Realistically, things could have happened differently, but it's no surprise why they went down the way they did.",
            "Just because it was in the past doesn't mean you can call it hindsight. It's been obvious to anyone with a non bias eye. He barely won in 2020 and approval only dropped significantly from there. There's only one conclusion from there.\n\nlikewise, as we know for sure now and was also clear, the incumbency advantage doesn't exist in the current climate.\n\nI am absolutely not surprised at the lack of hubris and strategy from the democratic party and how things played out. Just upset that it did."

I seriously suggesting reading through the subreddit:\n\n/r/WhatBidenHasDone/\n\n>Open borders? Stupid\n\nNot really a thing. Borders have always been guarded and policies for the most part have not changed in decades except for each president upping the amount of money for the border. Multiple presidents have granted amnesty to immigrants from Reagan to Bush Sr to Clinton, but certainly not Biden. You might be confused because Biden \"closed the border\" or more accurately shut down the border by executive order on June 4th of this year if illegal border crossings reached 2,500 immigrants. But you have to understand that it really meant shut down processing of amnesty seekers at the border and that the border wasn't open before that (you could never just walk or drive in without being stopped). Furthermore the reason why Biden did this by executive order is because congress wouldn't pass a bill that gave Biden the funds to protect the border and the reason congress wouldn't do it is because Trump told them to block any border bill (even the Republican one the senate made) since if Biden fixed the border problem Trump would have nothing to run on. So blame Trump for our border problems. \n\n> Print Heaps of Cash? Stupid.\n\nNot only did Biden not do this, to suggest that any president could belays an basic ignorance of how our government works. The treasury is only allowed to print money for two reasons. First is to replace old and damaged money, and second is to give to the Federal Reserve to lend out to banks who pay a certain interest rate the Federal Reserve sets to borrow that money. So when Trump says \"don't worry, America will always be able to pay its debts because the government can simply print more money.\" he is absolutely wrong. Debts in the US are paid for by bonds, specifically US treasury bills. \n\n> Say that riots are protests? Stupid\n\nYou mean the protests/riots that happened under Trump? Who cares what anyone calls them? And is that any dumber than Republicans pretending that January 6th were just some dumb tourists? \n\n> Having Biden in public? Stupid.\n\nWhat now? Your arguments are getting weaker and weaker here, so much so I have no idea what you trying to say. You think the president of the United States shouldn't be seen in public? LOL. Maybe you missed it but the election this year wasn't even between Biden versus Trump, it was Harris versus Trump. So you can take your imagined gripes with Biden and shove them, because none of them justify giving a monkey a shotgun.",

Zelensky also said something similar where Trump ran a campaign and centered much of his talk on a \u201cstrong\u201d deescalation. Yiu cou\u00f1d read this and say, great the russians and ukranians are ready to come to the table. Something they were not interested in doing under biden. Is this somehow a bad thing ? Ofc the results of the talks that they have to end the war matter. Zelensky wants 1991 borders. \n\nPutin wants 1990 assurances Nato had made when the Soviet Union was asked to turn over east berlin. We assured the Soviets we would not move nato and further to the east. What has happened since then ? Nato has continued to move east with an open door policy. How bad is that in terms of foreign policy ? If the main player in Nato being the US cant keep its word how many countries bordering Russia have we allowed and placed bases on since then. We walked away fron the ABMT of 1972, and placed silos right next to russia. \n\nThis war isnt what weve been spoon fed by the media here. Its not what putin said in that stupid interview with tucker carlson. It has to do with Nato increasing its size and inching closer to russia. Before Russia invaded ukraine a peace offer was placed on the table where russia only wanted in writing that ukraine would not be allowed in nato. And that idiot from norway declined. \n\nTrump has been highly critical of nato and rightfully so. We should absolutely have a strong alligance with the EU but the EU has to be its own force. Put nukes aside for a second and tell me what would happen if Russia had gone in strategically through europe without the help pf the US. Could France and Germany really hold back an advancing red army ? Well maybe since weve discovered that the soviets are a form of paper tiger. \n\nIf somehow my opinion mattered on the subject the EU should become the 2nd largest army in the world. They should gather together and use much more of their gdp and together make a european alliance that would rival russia and china. Not default back to the usa, and i believe trump has a similar vision. \n\nBack to peace in the ukranian war it looks like zelensky and putin are ready to end this war and thats perfect. Zelensky will have to realize that without us aid ukraine will fall the eu will not be able to help them enough to stop the russian advance. I totally respect ukraine for this and its a noble goal, but all they had to do was sign the peace treaty offer from russia stating they would not seek to join nato. \n\nYou can ask chatgpt if you want im not gonna search sources for this. \n\nSo thats why i didnt click on the article i really didnt want this huge rant and i cant be sure youre just a lib trying to make Trump orange hitler or if you really want to delve into foreign politics. \n\nCheers have a nice weekend",

The place has turned into a proto-prison-state in the last few years, moving towards the North Korean model.

            "It is as if Americans simply do not understand the purpose of taxes. (Or tarriffs). - If you paid some more in tax then you could get a fair, free scool system and a perfectly good, free health care system.\n\nThe absurd thing is that by paying those things over taxes the total cost for America would be much lower. - You could reduce nationwide health care costs with about 50% with no reduction in quantity or qualirty of the health care. - And children could get a proper education even with very poor parents or a struggeling single mother. So there would end up being more smart people in the USA. And you really, really need them these days.\n\nPaying more in tax would on the other hand reduce family costs for both education and health care. So on average this would be a benefit for all. Exept for the insurance companies which will go out of business. They are not needed when things are done this way.",
            "How much more than the legal minimum to stay out of Jail do you pay in taxes? I have to assume that since you have such a deep, rich appreciation of taxation, you'd never limit yourself just to what you HAD to pay. That's what THOSE IDIOTS who don't know how lucky they are to pay taxes do.\n\nSo how much more?"

The emoluments lawsuits that were filed during his first term took so long they ended up being rendered moot since he had already left office by the time they got to the Supreme Court. No doubt that's exactly what they're counting on happening again.\n\n>I've never fully understood why so few people seem to care about Trump's flagrant corruption. The Democrats only half-heartedly investigated it and certainly didn't bother to make it a campaign issue. Apparently, not selling the presidency to the highest bidder is just another one of those vaunted norms that was easily discarded, soon to be forgotten.

Rudy Giuliani -- you know lying Rudy -- even tried to use inside lines to government agencies like the IRS to carry out this mockery of justice.

The autocratic, fascist Republican party seeks only to use lawfare in order to punish their political opponents.  I tell you, if they would've gotten away with this, it would have set a disgusting precedent for them to make up any lies they want, and go after you beautiful, patriotic Americans.  They really do hate our country.  Thank God that Biden was here to protect it - to protect America from these corrupt clowns.",

They\u2019ve pissed all the other countries with it. These elements are among others need for tech development and production. The US only has one shuttered germanium mine in Alaska that will take years to bring up to production and that is if they can pass all of the ecological requirements. It is a nasty mineral to process.\n\nGallium on the other hand is available from Canada, another country that Trump is belittling and threatening. Given the mood of the Canadian population is to say \u201cFuck all of the Americans\u201d at this point I don\u2019t expect that to go well.\n\nThis is just the opening round.\n\nAluminum and Stainless steel for automobile production are about to become very expensive. Electricity and oil imports as well. This will force manufacturers to raise their prices with the new costs driving up inflation and their labor costs.\n\nThe only shining light in any of this chaos is that it may crash the US dollar making America more competitive although no longer such a good place for investment dollars.",

            "Very painful. So a 25 percent tariff across the board will result in a minimum of a 50 percent price increase on the low end and upwards of a 100 percent price increase in the high end. So if your a service provider that relies on imported parts to do your job you have to raise your prices substantially something like double what you were previously charging.\n\nNow if your forced to double your prices in a short amount of time the volume of sales will drop by 75 percent. Which means you'll reduce staff by that amount whenever possible.\n\nOne example would be housing which relies on a substantial amount of imported parts to build new units. By applying a 25 percent tariffs as it feeds through the chain end costs of the house will be 2 to 3 times more expensive which will price almost all Americans out of new housing.\n\nAnother example is automotive which also uses a huge amount of parts for import they will see 50 percent prices increases at a minimum.  That will reduce the number of sales by 1/3rd. And repairs will get way more expensive which will cause consumers to shift spending eating into food and entertainment budgets.\n\nThen there is the petroleum because most of our refinery capacity isn't designed to refine petroleum we mine in the US you'll see a 100 to 200 percent price increase on gas prices as companies rapidly transition their equipment.\n\nFood prices will skyrocket as companies pass on tariffs prices especially in the winter months where prices could spike 4 times higher as companies push both the tariffs costs and the risks associated with Trump onto consumers.\n\nAnd then there is the flip side as countervailing tariffs get implemented and companies layoff workers as they lose their overseas markets.\n\nEssially a uniformed 25 percent across the board tariffs is a bit like nuking your own people which is extremely foolish indeed.\n\nDon't get me wrong tariffs are a great tool for certain situations but the way Trump is attempting to use that tool shows how little he understands about economics and international trade.",
            "Not very, cause like everything he says he\u2019s gonna do it\u2019s just a lie.  MMW There will be no across the board tariffs. There will be very few targeted ones.  Most likely a continuation of the current ones started by Trump and continued by Biden.",

BTW, those are permanent, but he let the tax cut for the poor expire.",

Stay healthy as you can, so you don't need to use the healthcare system as much.\n6. Vote in the midterms and take power away from the Right.\n7.

Get a bit more cold on the rest of the country.  Roughly 75% of the country is responsible for Trump winning again, so at this point people will suffer, and you're going to have to get a bit selfish and ignore their pain to focus on your own safety and sanity.\n\nYeah, maybe the local shop will go out of business, or people who voted for Trump end up losing their jobs and struggling, or Gen Zers who kept thinking they would buy a house soon will find out they're years away from any kind of financial stability...but you have to now be a little cold and let them suffer.  Only way they're going to learn what many of us have been trying to tell them for decades.\n\nI know this sounds horrible, but after 32 years of telling people that the modern GOP will screw them all, I'm done.

That the only way we could perhaps push them to lower the prices if we suddenly went one or two months without buying eggs. \n\nShe agreed with me, but told me she can't live without the eggs so she's just going to bite the bullet. \n\nThe moral to the story is that these companies are not going to lower the prices unless they suddenly see their sales dropping and losses coming. It's like an airline that charges too much for seats, but now it's an hour before the flight and they have 10 seats available, and it's a better deal for them to sell them cheap as opposed to having 10 empty seats on a flight. \n\nThey're not going to lower the price of eggs until we stop buying them. The sadder is Trump could put tariffs on things, and they'll raise the prices again, and then let's say a new Democratic administration in 2028 removes all the tariffs, and they won't lower those prices. Not as long as people are willing to pay them. \n\nEconomist basically say that the only way around all this is when people are out there, pushing to make more money and getting raises. However, those are becoming incredibly hard to get nowadays, as companies are looking for every way to reduce wages and even force people to take pay cuts through layoffs. \n\nThis is again why I'm not very sympathetic anymore to all these people that voted for Trump or didn't bother to show up. They want to talk to death about eggs and gas and they honestly don't know how capitalism and the economy works. So they shot themselves in the foot hoping the companies will decide to lower the prices. They're in for a big surprise."

            "I hear you, but the one thing I tell many people that bring up how the election was so close is that half the country didn't bother to even show up. Half the country perhaps knew the stakes but figured that there was no point, or many of that half just choose to not be informed about anything, yet they will obviously complain about everything. \n\nI remember after election day, someone had calculated that it was roughly 28% of the voting population that picked Donald Trump. I think it might have gone down to 23% now that everything has been tallied. You throw in that roughly 50% that didn't show up, and in my book 75% of the country is responsible for Donald Trump getting a second term. \n\nThis is why I stopped caring. After 32 years of trying to tell peers and others how much the modern conservative movement is not for the average person and are just cronies for the donor class, these people still think somehow the trickle-down economics is going to one day work, and all the other BS that's fed to them by all of the propaganda media created by the right wing. \n\nI'm personally done trying to save the public from itself. I'm honestly at the point that I don't care if people are going to be suffering over the next 4 years. All those people that voted for Trump or didn't bother to show up at all. I'm not going to feel sorry for them when they are complaining about grocery prices, gas prices, job losses, freedoms being taken away, corruption, etc. Knowing that 23% to 28%, they'll just blame immigrants, brown people, teachers, and unions. \n\nI've been telling anyone that voted for Harris and anyone with a brain to insulate yourself and your finances. Keep your stuff in order. So when Trump and his cronies trash the economy, you're not going to lose everything. Lord knows the wealthy donor class aren't going to lose much, but everyone at the bottom is going to lose even more. Work to insulate yourself so you're part of that bunch that doesn't lose much. Live in a blue area that's going to fight back and keep freedom alive. \n\nBut that's it. I'm done with trying to get people to understand. I don't agree with all of these liberals that are saying the fight must continue. I say let's have everybody suffer for 4 years and maybe they're finally going to learn everything the left has been trying to tell them for how many decades. \n\nI can't feel sorry for people that somehow bought into Trump's BS, but they have no clue how the economy actually works, and how tariffs actually work. They brought their suffering on themselves. They're the people that made a major purchase without doing the research. No sympathy.",

We\u2019ve been dealing with tariffs and reciprocity since the days of Sir John A MacDonald and weathered them all. We know that rolling over only help some rich people.\n\nOur day to day business between companies cross border is constant. What tariffs do is a macro-event. Oil Prices will rise driving inflation across the board. Our Coal is required for manufacturing steel in both countries. We have the minerals required for new technologies that China controls elsewhere in the world. \n\nInflation affects stock markets negatively, fixed instrument values (Bonds, securities) and corresponding foreign exchange rates. Besides the noise at the consumer level this impacts the money markets where most of the wealth of the 1% is located. They don\u2019t give a shit about the price of gas or employment unless it affects their investment strategy. These people hate political noise.\n\nWe had inflation, an immigration problem and drug smuggling back all the sway into Trump\u2019s previous presidency. Biden and the central banks cleaned a lot of it up. Trudeau even got on board with back-tracking on his immigration policies. We\u2019re getting better at tracking drugs but it\u2019s a whack-a-mole game with precursor chemicals.\n\nInflation was back below 2% in Canada in October and the TSX is out performing markets around the world. The Bank of Canada is expected to drop another 1% on the prime rate in January. The US Fed should follow that but Trump will fuck that up. Where\u2019s the crisis and complacency you think we have now? \n\nThis is a bullshit play by Trump for attention and he deserves whatever all of the other countries do to the USA. He\u2019s inheriting a stable and growing economy and wants to disrupt it because it focuses a lot of attention on him personally. As for his conspiracy nuts and American Christian backers.

Maybe people are now suddenly ready to respond better to it. I don't know. \n\nBut what I do know is that the recent loss to Trump has turned into a free-for-all for everyone to trot out their pet issue and claim that if only the party/candidate had done X, said Y, then we would have won in a landslide! In fact, the only reason we lost is because the party/candidate *didn't listen* to me and the people who think like me! It's proof that we are right and everyone else is wrong! And now everyone is beginning to realize we were right all along!  About time! Here's the truth that everyone must now take as self-evident. (pick one) \n\n* We lost because our candidate didn't Bernie hard enough\n* We lost because our candidate didn't go on enough dudebro podcasts\n* We lost because our candidate campaigned with Liz fucking Cheney\n* We lost because there was no primary\n* We lost because a Democrat went on television and pointed out that by a lot of measures the economy is pretty darned good right now\n* We lost because Joe didn't drop out quick enough\n* We lost because \"elites\" forced Joe out\n* We lost because \"elites\" chose the candidate\n\nPeople, we lost because prices are too high.

Yes, there could be programs to help college students get off the ground, but ultimately, if you want to fix the debt, then you need to target these high interest loans themselves with other means, rather than cancel them outright.

It's time to let that go. There's going to be a need for Democrats to compromise on a *lot* of details for this in order to gain GOP support, and I know that's not going to sit well with leftists.\n\n- The left needs to realize that they are not the center of the universe, and the need to riot, and destroy college campuses to protest every little thing going on in the world is fucking absurd.

Dems have a two step problem, we suck at messaging and our party is captured by the traditional consulting firms that get paid by and have worked for mega corps. So they have no incentive to actually change things, and on top of that they suck at telling people what good things the party actually did. You have to actually change something significantly enough for everyone to feel or notice it, and then you have to explain to everyone what that was, not just the people already subscribed to traditional media who are already locked in to supporting their favorite candidates.",

The later seems to be your stance. If it's not, then the other things that could have led to us winning are much more worth discussing than just the reality of inflation. \n\nAs far as why those things could have changed the outcome I'd say the race was ultimately decided by 1.6%.

She is the protege of Amlo who took a 'hugs not bullets' stance when it came to dealing with Narcos. yes mexico has one of the worst murder rates, femicide rates, press homicide rates in the world, but to blame the US and the gun control problem is very disingenuous. Until the rampant corruption that spreads throughout all forms of govt in Mexico is taken care off, it will continue to be one step away from being a narco state. If anything the only thing this tariff war will do is make Mexico cozy up to China even more.",

Maybe people are now suddenly ready to respond better to it. I don't know. \n\nBut what I do know is that the recent loss to Trump has turned into a free-for-all for everyone to trot out their pet issue and claim that if only the party/candidate had done X, said Y, then we would have won in a landslide! In fact, the only reason we lost is because the party/candidate *didn't listen* to me and the people who think like me! It's proof that we are right and everyone else is wrong! And now everyone is beginning to realize we were right all along!  About time! Here's the truth that everyone must now take as self-evident. (pick one) \n\n* We lost because our candidate didn't Bernie hard enough\n* We lost because our candidate didn't go on enough dudebro podcasts\n* We lost because our candidate campaigned with Liz fucking Cheney\n* We lost because there was no primary\n* We lost because a Democrat went on television and pointed out that by a lot of measures the economy is pretty darned good right now\n* We lost because Joe didn't drop out quick enough\n* We lost because \"elites\" forced Joe out\n* We lost because \"elites\" chose the candidate\n\nPeople, we lost because prices are too high. Fact. Please do fight on for the changes you'd like to see in American politics and in the Democratic Party. But let's not kid ourselves about why we lost this cycle.",

That is no fucking liberal and he's an idiot to boot.\n\nI didn't see the dems ignore the working class in this election at all.  Trump offers them nothing, but somehow makes them believe he does.  Really just about creating resentment\" towards \"elites\"  (which really mean educated people more than rich people) Trump actually plays off the language of guys like bernie to his advantage.\n\n  \nbernie would have got his ass wiped in either election, much worse than Hilary or kamala.  I'd love to see the oligarchy brought down too, good luck with that one.\n\nIt's the fucking far left that helped elect trump, not liberals ignoring the \"working classes\" who mainly don't know how to vote in their best interests.",

Democrats need to start focusing again on economy, jobs, education and infrastructure, and need to start distancing themselves from the far left nutjobs who dot social media, and other places yelling for stupid nonsensical policies that will never take wind in the real world. \n\n- Your loans are your own to pay off. Yes, there could be programs to help college students get off the ground, but ultimately, if you want to fix the debt, then you need to target these high interest loans themselves with other means, rather than cancel them outright. Otherwise, we just find ourselves right back at square one, with new generations of students taking out high interest loans that they expect will just be \"canceled\" later on.\n\n- Medicare for all is a pipe dream. It's time to let that go. There's going to be a need for Democrats to compromise on a *lot* of details for this in order to gain GOP support, and I know that's not going to sit well with leftists.\n\n- The left needs to realize that they are not the center of the universe, and the need to riot, and destroy college campuses to protest every little thing going on in the world is fucking absurd. Israel is not going anywhere. America is not going to divest from a crucial Middle Eastern ally. The \"Queers For Palestine\" people need to take a seat a learn a thing or two about Civics.",

You know who else understands this? Every millionare/billionare executive and board memeber of all six of the corporations who produce food for the American market. And guess what, all of thier taxes are about to be dissolved perminanatly.\n\nThe Democrats are fools, they should have known to fight fire with fire. Nobody became a millionare or billionare doing all the right things on the way to thier money. The 99% of the politicians on both sides sold out Democracy for thier personal wealth, influence and power.",

FIrst, 90% of counties voted slightly rightward than they historically have done. I guarantee Sheboygan county Wisconsin wasn't lost because of Palestine. What issue effects damned near everyone? Prices. Everyone buys shit, everyone sees it. Data point two: same phenomenon took down incumbents all over the world. It wasn't just us.",
            "He definitely does. But I have observed that his brand of politics isn't quite popular enough to win reliably, not without an assist. He got one in 2016 from Comey and Putin and won. He didn't get one in 2020 and he lost. He got one in 2024 in the form of post-pandemic inflation and he won.",

Trump changes shit and lies and tells people life is better for them, and it is for some people momentarily, and that story gets repeated enough people believe it. Dems have a two step problem, we suck at messaging and our party is captured by the traditional consulting firms that get paid by and have worked for mega corps. So they have no incentive to actually change things, and on top of that they suck at telling people what good things the party actually did. You have to actually change something significantly enough for everyone to feel or notice it, and then you have to explain to everyone what that was, not just the people already subscribed to traditional media who are already locked in to supporting their favorite candidates.",
            "But there's a difference between \"Inflation was the main reason we won\" and \"There's nothing we could have done to win this race because of inflation\". The later seems to be your stance. If it's not, then the other things that could have led to us winning are much more worth discussing than just the reality of inflation. \n\nAs far as why those things could have changed the outcome I'd say the race was ultimately decided by 1.6%. A pretty close election by historical standards. If we lost because of the incumbent inflation issue it's pretty reasonable to assume that we could overcome 1.6% by not running an incumbent. Something a primary would have given us.",

Had their been a primary where we selected someone not as unlikable and entrenched in the current things people are upset with Dems would have stood a much better chance to beat Trump.",
            "I think that the under-informed (which is most people) will lean toward an understanding of economics based on their sentiments regarding those two \u2018tribes\u2019 and that those \u2018tribes\u2019 are defined by either leaning into maintaining an antiquated hierarchical cultural structure based on a pile of bigotries or leaning against it. \n\nI think since the 1970s there\u2019s been a popular but false economic story that was sold to people unhappy about the changes brought about by the civil rights movement and second wave feminism. \n\nI think most people, just by growing up in this country, understand at least subconsciously the link between that story and the two parties and the public perception of who the parties are \u2018for\u2019.",

            "Just because it was in the past doesn't mean you can call it hindsight. It's been obvious to anyone with a non bias eye. He barely won in 2020 and approval only dropped significantly from there. There's only one conclusion from there.\n\nlikewise, as we know for sure now and was also clear, the incumbency advantage doesn't exist in the current climate.\n\nI am absolutely not surprised at the lack of hubris and strategy from the democratic party and how things played out. Just upset that it did."

And I'm not waxing hyperbole. We saw what he did in his previous 4 years, and anybody with real understanding of economics knows what he's going to bring, and it's not going to be cheaper gas, lower grocery prices, and high paying jobs aplenty. \n\nThe only thing I have to tell to the opposition that had the brains not to vote for him is to spend the next 4 years not getting easily triggered by every stupid thing this guy says. Every time he says something controversial, that's when the Republican Congress tries to pass something that we will especially hate. Put your energy on that.",

            "> Man, just my opinion after watching what Prez Biden/Vp Harris have attempted to implement over the past 4 years, made it pretty clear to most people thinking about things practically and not emotionally, they were fuxking shit up. \n\nReading the rest of your comment it seems pretty clear that you don't actually know what Biden did. I seriously suggesting reading through the subreddit:\n\n/r/WhatBidenHasDone/\n\n>Open borders? Stupid\n\nNot really a thing. Borders have always been guarded and policies for the most part have not changed in decades except for each president upping the amount of money for the border. Multiple presidents have granted amnesty to immigrants from Reagan to Bush Sr to Clinton, but certainly not Biden. You might be confused because Biden \"closed the border\" or more accurately shut down the border by executive order on June 4th of this year if illegal border crossings reached 2,500 immigrants. But you have to understand that it really meant shut down processing of amnesty seekers at the border and that the border wasn't open before that (you could never just walk or drive in without being stopped). Furthermore the reason why Biden did this by executive order is because congress wouldn't pass a bill that gave Biden the funds to protect the border and the reason congress wouldn't do it is because Trump told them to block any border bill (even the Republican one the senate made) since if Biden fixed the border problem Trump would have nothing to run on. So blame Trump for our border problems. \n\n> Print Heaps of Cash? Stupid.\n\nNot only did Biden not do this, to suggest that any president could belays an basic ignorance of how our government works. The treasury is only allowed to print money for two reasons. First is to replace old and damaged money, and second is to give to the Federal Reserve to lend out to banks who pay a certain interest rate the Federal Reserve sets to borrow that money. So when Trump says \"don't worry, America will always be able to pay its debts because the government can simply print more money.\" he is absolutely wrong. Debts in the US are paid for by bonds, specifically US treasury bills. \n\n> Say that riots are protests? Stupid\n\nYou mean the protests/riots that happened under Trump? Who cares what anyone calls them? And is that any dumber than Republicans pretending that January 6th were just some dumb tourists? \n\n> Having Biden in public? Stupid.\n\nWhat now? Your arguments are getting weaker and weaker here, so much so I have no idea what you trying to say. You think the president of the United States shouldn't be seen in public? LOL. Maybe you missed it but the election this year wasn't even between Biden versus Trump, it was Harris versus Trump. So you can take your imagined gripes with Biden and shove them, because none of them justify giving a monkey a shotgun.",
            "First off it's [aluminum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urglg3WimHA). Secondly Democratic [backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding) is a real thing that has been happening across the globe, where even an autocrat like Putin pretends he was fairly elected. And while federalism does give the US a little more protection from this, it isn't foolproof especially given the number of Republican governors. Third, some of the same people who think it's crazy to believe that a US election can be stolen are still telling us to this day that the 2020 election was stolen. It wasn't, but that doesn't mean it's impossible.",

Zelensky also said something similar where Trump ran a campaign and centered much of his talk on a \u201cstrong\u201d deescalation. Yiu cou\u00f1d read this and say, great the russians and ukranians are ready to come to the table. Something they were not interested in doing under biden. Is this somehow a bad thing ? Ofc the results of the talks that they have to end the war matter. Zelensky wants 1991 borders. \n\nPutin wants 1990 assurances Nato had made when the Soviet Union was asked to turn over east berlin. We assured the Soviets we would not move nato and further to the east. What has happened since then ? Nato has continued to move east with an open door policy. How bad is that in terms of foreign policy ? If the main player in Nato being the US cant keep its word how many countries bordering Russia have we allowed and placed bases on since then. We walked away fron the ABMT of 1972, and placed silos right next to russia. \n\nThis war isnt what weve been spoon fed by the media here. Its not what putin said in that stupid interview with tucker carlson. It has to do with Nato increasing its size and inching closer to russia. Before Russia invaded ukraine a peace offer was placed on the table where russia only wanted in writing that ukraine would not be allowed in nato. And that idiot from norway declined. \n\nTrump has been highly critical of nato and rightfully so. We should absolutely have a strong alligance with the EU but the EU has to be its own force. Put nukes aside for a second and tell me what would happen if Russia had gone in strategically through europe without the help pf the US. Could France and Germany really hold back an advancing red army ? Well maybe since weve discovered that the soviets are a form of paper tiger. \n\nIf somehow my opinion mattered on the subject the EU should become the 2nd largest army in the world. They should gather together and use much more of their gdp and together make a european alliance that would rival russia and china. Not default back to the usa, and i believe trump has a similar vision. \n\nBack to peace in the ukranian war it looks like zelensky and putin are ready to end this war and thats perfect. Zelensky will have to realize that without us aid ukraine will fall the eu will not be able to help them enough to stop the russian advance. I totally respect ukraine for this and its a noble goal, but all they had to do was sign the peace treaty offer from russia stating they would not seek to join nato. \n\nYou can ask chatgpt if you want im not gonna search sources for this. \n\nSo thats why i didnt click on the article i really didnt want this huge rant and i cant be sure youre just a lib trying to make Trump orange hitler or if you really want to delve into foreign politics. \n\nCheers have a nice weekend",

They don't care about anything else at all, though they pretend otherwise.  They have a short memory, and can be easily manipulated by anyone who has no compunction to tell the truth about things.  It's a Big Brother situation.  \n\nWe are a species of barking seals, lining up waiting for the fish treats.

Are we OK with full trade-disengagement?  We've been slowly heading that way for years now, but it's still an enormous volume.  How far would we go to defend our allies in the region, considering all those trade issues?\n\nChina may have already decided that they're better off in the long run without any dependencies on Western tech and trade.  The leadership's position might be stronger in a total-war footing than in a complicated peace where they can't control the narrative to their home audience.  The place has turned into a proto-prison-state in the last few years, moving towards the North Korean model.   A war might be perceived as useful to the regime, if not the people or their economy.\n\nAnyway, the easiest way to start a war is to signal that we are diffident and weak-willed, with unsure priorities.   I think it seems more likely than not right now.   And if we sacrifice Taiwan for peace, would the Philippines or Malaysia trust us?  It's a slippery slope.",

US is just a bubble and as soon as other countries stop spewing money into US, the bubble will burst.",

Because those weapons might be used to fight, and it saves lives to simply allow invasion.\n\n> Is that lost Ukraine territory worth triggering WWIII? No.\n\nWhy didn't the US aid to Ukraine already trigger WWIII? And how exactly would Russia harm us militarily? They can't even take Ukraine without help.",

            ">It's not about policy no matter how much people insist that it is. We know this because in places like Missouri voters just passed initiatives for abortion rights, an increase in the minimum wage, and paid sick leave, all Democratic policies, while overwhelmingly voting for a Republican senator and president who both strongly oppose these things. This is about aesthetics and attitudes. A majority of Americans want an autocratic strongman show and Trump and the Republicans are happy to give it to them."

Why would you give a convicted rapist the benefit of the doubt when he says I\u2019m going to do that whether the women like it or not?Why did he specify women? \n\nIf you are defending him in this, you should look at the broader context. He\u2019s doing all this while former aides are calling him a fascist. What do fascist heads do? They do whatever whether you like it or not.\n\nDo you think this guy is going to make you personally more or less free? Do you think this guy is going to make women more or less free? Do you think this guy is going to, for the first time in history, impose dramatic tariffs and avoid inflation? Do you think this guy is going to solve all the problems that come with immigration while maintaining the benefits? \n\nOr do you think that maybe, just maybe, he is power hungry, and has more selfish motives for wanting to be president?",
            "It is literally what Trump said.\n\nTrump is a rapist who tells women he's going to do things to them whether they like it or not.\n\nHe doesn't ask for consent, he does what he wants.\n\nThere is no context that makes it OK to say he isn't asking for consent.",
            "That doesn't add any context that matters.\n\nThe point is that women don't want his protection for a variety of very good reasons.  His idea of protection is not the same as what most women think is protection, and he's going to force it on them anyway.  Women know he doesn't care if they consent, he's demonstrated that many times.  He will impose himself on them, and no self respecting woman wants that.",

There is no opinion expressed.\n\nBut, I will now post another article which includes Trump's horrific quote in the title, because you have encouraged me to do so. Apparently this story needs a lot of attention.",

The Orange S\\*\\*\\*gibbon really said this, and it really doesn't come as a surprise to most of us. It's reflective of his attitude towards everyone else on the planet in general, but to women in particular ... he has been a real monster due to this mentality.\n\nHe is, after all, an actual sex offender. That has been established in court, and that's without even counting ANY of his felony convictions.",

It\u2019s happened to societies all over the world after the COVID-induced inflation gripped all developed countries.   I doubt that any US incumbent could have won.  And it saddens me to say it, but I think there\u2019s a disturbing number of people, Dems included, who don\u2019t want a woman of color to have the highest office.   Harris ran a great campaign.

Though back-ass as hell, was a plan for a growing illegal migration and a growing economic issue. 'Stay in Mexico?' Where Trump was literally paying 1/100th of what it takes to house migrants here, was housing, feeding, and clothing migrants while they got citizenship? An actually good plan. The froo-froo feel good legislation names full of back-alley deals attached as Riders pissed off a ton of people also, especially when it was discovered that one of these riders, attached by the Democrat Party removed 'Drinkable Water' from a basic list of human rights so that cities could ignore the failing public water systems for beautification efforts.\n\nAnd no, a declaration of \"We're not switching to Electric Cars!\", for example, is not a plan. A plan looks like this: 1: Identify a problem. 2: Identify what changes need to be made. 3. A declaration of how you are going to fix said problem.\n\nAlso, enough about 'Global Warming' or 'Assisting (Identity Group).' Focus on things that matter to the perspective of your constituents in their daily life. Including: 1: Fixing our undrinkable tap water issues. 2: Bringing Jobs back to America. 3: Getting K-12 Schools focused on making people employable after graduation. 4: Getting necessities to modern life (Food, Energy, Homes) back to where we can afford them. Once the constituents lives are actually back to normal, once we can actually afford homes/food/gas, people will care about that kinda stuff again (except maybe Global Warming. If the scientists were right, we'd have died back in 2000.)",

In times where the economy's fine and infrastructure's not failing, where people can drink from the faucets, go get food from a store, own a house and at least one car? That would be okay. However, her campaign felt like that cartoon pannel of the dog in the flaming house saying 'This is Fine' while America is burning down around her.\n\nThis happened in 2016 also. Every Hillary, in 2016, and Kamala, in 2024, Campaign Office I visited couldn't tell me thing one about: plans to help the economy, plans to fix our failing infrastructures, plans to convert to clean energy without disrupting energy consumption, plans to help house and feed the growing migrant population, how to improve public schools, etc. \n\nRemember this for 2028: People would sooner follow the village idiot if they have a plan, than the smartest person in the room if they're pretty much just shrugging and say \"I've got nothing. Lets just wing it.\"",

They were excited to vote for him in the General.\n\nThe Democrats told primary voters to screw off and appointed Biden, even though they knew he was in sharp decline. No need for the party voters to get involved, though!  Then they appointed a candidate who polled at 0% among Democrats when she ran in 2020 and dropped out before the first primary..\n\nI kinda feel like explanations that eschew this angle are incomplete. Trump voters WANTED to vote for Trump. For as hard as the left worked to gaslight us into thinking they were super pumped about Kamala, they were not.

In the end it's all about the money.\n\nEDIT: I am using speech to text and it will sometimes capitalize words for reasons that I don't understand. It appears that it capitalized the word truth in my first sentence above and because of this I'm being accused of sending out subtle signals to true believers of the president elect.

            "No, no, and no. The fatal flaw in both 2016 and 2024 is the Democrats ignoring 1 simple thing: Plans make the masses feel good. Hillary's campaign was not presenting plans for the problems America faced. Neither was Kamala's. Sure, they talk about global warming, and the plights of all the identity/minority groups, but here's the problem with that: The AVERAGE VOTER only cares about those things when they've got lots of extra spending money, fresh drinkable water coming in through their pipes, and can afford to buy a house/new car instead of being stuck permarenting/taking public transport. These are status symbols, and America loves status symbols. Why do you think the brand new video game systems are bought out before release day even happens? Because, even though there may be only a handfull of titles at launch, and most people tend to go back to the old systems for a while unless there's backwards compatability... unless one or more of the new systems' games is like a Ghosts of Tsushima, is because of the status that having the newest/best brings. Since the Bush Administration, America has declined to the point where America has grown lean enough on these things to make people latch onto ANY plan to return to the financial 'good old days' of the 1990s.\n\nAs for being ineligible... no he was still eligible. And here's why:\n\n1: Trump was never convicted of insurrection.\n\n2. The legal process in New York was not completed. If New York could have gotten that win, and gotten all the appeals out of the way, BEFORE parties could file paperwork for candidates to start primarying, yes. However, New York was too little, too late. Before someone can get stricken from the ability to run for office over felonies, the entire legal process has to play out.",

The problem you have, and it seems most people on your side have, is an inability to take an objective look at the facts and ask yourself what might actually be going on. \n\nMaybe it's just me but I find it hysterical that the party that went on and on about democracy, and how important democracy is, and we've got to protect democracy has for three election cycles now not really held real primaries, 2016 and 2020 were fixed. And 2024 for the most part they were canceled. They were even sued in Florida and the courts sided with them saying saying that we're private party and could do whatever they wanted as far as selecting their nominee. Then when what had been obvious to anybody with eyes and ears for months was exposed to be beyond the truth at a poorly run debate and the candidate stepped out, was there any sort of democratic process too choose the next nominee or were they anointed? \n\nAlthough they control both houses of Congress the majority in the house is so slim it might as well be a 50/50 tie.

            "No, the Fatal Flaw was that Trump had Dirt on Nancy Pelosi and most of the old timers he was going to release if the Insurrection Trial continued to play out. This is WHY we need term limits. America is pretty blase towards corruption, but only to a point. After about 12 years (2 senate terms or 3 terms in the House), about 90-95% of modern politicians hit a level of perceived corruption even Americans find abhorrent. Perceived as in, I could make a claim and enough Americans will believe it. Look at Alex Jones' Adrenochrome claims. Believable because we've got enough old people who've been in congress 30, 40, even 50 years that people believe they'd do ANYTHING to continue to hold onto power. Which, in some cases on both sides of the aisle, is true. FFS, Nesle, our largest bottled water maker, has paid both political parties to rule that Clean Drinking WATER was not a human right.\n\nThat said...\n\nThe biggest flaws are something that nobody's willing to look at: Overconfidence. The Democratic Party believes it's own hype. In my state, they actually believed that Kamala could win by playing the \"I've got a vagina and melanin\" card. Like the Kamala Ads here came just short of her appearing on screen and literally saying this. Their campaign offices couldn't answer a single question about her political stances, and were pompous assholes with a superiority complex. They act like the tactics that worked when America was financially fine, when most people could worry about things besides \"How am I going to feed/clothe/shelter myself/my family\" would still work.

            "Even beyond that, the fault lies with Biden and the Democrats doing zero messaging for four years and leaving holes for Trump's, Musk's, snd Russia's misinformation campaigns that went unopposed.\u00a0 Couple this with people like Joe Rogan, numerous huge comics, radio hosts, and others on the right wing convincing people to not get educations with this class being the ones who voted trump overwhelmingly.\n\n\nAny solutions are generational at this point.\u00a0 By then, Alaska will have been sold back to russia and the union will be extremely weak.\n\n\nThere's zero doubt we're in the empire decline phase because of all the exploits it thought it could afford to allow exist and now a party that is an avatar for the kremlin is in place because russia fucked up with the UK.\u00a0 So now they got the US and their goal is still to destroy the EU.",

They are the future of this country.\"\n\n>Anonymous Biden campaign sources told American political news site Politico the year before that it was \"virtually inconceivable\" Biden would run for re-election in 2024.\n\n>Asked about his \"bridge\" comments and what had changed since then, Biden attributed it to the gravity of the situation he inherited in terms of the economy, foreign policy and domestic division.\n\nAt best he deliberately misled the American people about his his intentions.",

I make it a habit to follow the news on both sides of the spectrum. It's about the only way you can come to some kind of reasonable conclusion about what the facts might actually be. \n\nOne of the funniest parts about this election to me is there's nothing that can be cried about as far as how the process went down. You can't complain that he barely won the electoral college, or that he didn't win the popular vote. You also can't continue to keep insulting the electorate and believe it is going to help you politically. When the leaders of the party come out and start insulting their core constituency and some sort of weird maybe we can shame them into voting the way we want them to vote it's always going to backfire \n\nI don't know how to tell you this but what you assume to be an insult toward me something that just makes me laugh, it's the realization that you're unable to examine what's right in front of you in any way other than how it confirms the beliefs you've been propagandized into accepting \n\nFor the record, I have never voted for the president elect, I have always viewed him as somewhat of a joke. That said there was a much funnier joke on the other side this time.",
            "No they did not. Not where it counted. Not in their Campaign offices. And not in their commercials. Do you think the average American watches debates? No. They watch Reality TV, pro wrestling (and think it's real), and the like. Yet, because my State's 90% Blue, their campaign staff in the state can't be bothered to do shit.",
            "So then he misled millions by implying?  Because that's what people were clearly discerning from what he said. \n\nI am glad that Trump voters got over their complaints about Biden's age though.... So there's that",

Yes, She talked about shit on MSNBC, which nobody here watches because, again, 90% are mouth breathers, or Debates (see MSNBC notation). No, if the Democrats want their message to reach the people here, the campaign office needs to know what the fuck is going on, and they need shows like the View to talk about her plans instead of just ragging on Orange Man Bad like he's their deadbeat baby daddy. Trump's always taken his message to the people through low-brow means which works because most Americans are fucking stupider than you fucking give them fucking credit for and low brow entertainment to them is the equivalent to Opera or the Ballet to the cultured.\n\nSo pull your head out of your ass. Because the stupid far outnumber the smart in this country, and you guys practically alienate them by ignoring them and sticking to your base in Academia. Where was Kamala's \"Michelle Obama on Ellen\" moment? Americans have not fucking changed since Baby Bush took office. The only thing smart about us are our mouths and phones. FFS, At least Obama knew to fucking pander to the masses.",

Also and I suppose given your limited intellect you haven't noticed this but I've never once referred to anyone by name. I do not speak that name. If somewhere the word truth got capitalized I had nothing to do with it and I am certainly not a part of that delusional group of people. \n\nBelieve what you want to believe, I'm telling you you're wrong. I don't know anyone that is pro the president elect that is not vocally pro. Certainly on social media where you can be anonymous and say even crazier things than you might in real life, though given my experience with the delusional I know that this is not true. And of course that applies to both sides. \n\nYou have been propaganda eyes ( right there is a speech to text thing, rather than propagandized, it said propaganda eyes, what you got to admit is pretty funny) to the point where you are only able to see people through one of two filters. If you don't want to open your eyes and try to understand things on your own there's nothing I can do to help you. However there are so many excellent sources online from both sides that will give you enough good relevant information that you can make up your own mind about things within without having to goose step to your parties marching orders. \n\nJust think of all the people that went around spending the better part of the week scolding people over the pronunciation of the vice president's name. And telling the American public that if they did not pronounce it the proper way they were either misogynist or racist or worse. Then you can go look for video of these same people pronouncing her name half a dozen different ways. How ridiculous is that? Is that really how you're going to gain the upper hand in the political Battle of what was said to be a lifetime, and now even the president of the United States is brushing off with well we'll get them next time. \n\nYou're actually unable to engage in any kind of discussion of the issues because all you can do is call people names. Basically you don't really know anything other than what you've been propagandized with and apparently you're unable to even repeat that short of just saying you're a supporter you're a supporter and it doesn't matter that you say you're not because I know that you are, please...\n\n\nEDIT: okay, I found the capitalization that you were so worried about, I'm going to give it to you on that one, that it would seem to be a hidden message to the faithful. Once again you can believe what you want to or not but I have not so much as downloaded the app. Anything I have ever seen from it has been posted in a news article. I'm also not on its rival app, it just bores me.",

            "Didn't make a difference. She was part of an incumbent administration during a period of high inflation. She was screwed. The only way for a Democrat to win in this environment would be to run against the Biden administration as an outsider Democrat. Kamala couldn't have done that. Democrats voted for competent leadership. Republicans voted for the man who thinks that he can fix inflation with tariffs (and they apparently didn't mind the felonies/ rapes/lies/ sedition).",

She didn't lose because she didn't go on Joe Rogan's idiotic podcast.\n\nIt was always going to be close because there are just that many American voters who really dig Trump's racism and misogyny. Maybe not enough of them to win without an assist, though. In 2016 that assist was James Comey and Vladimir Putin. There was no significant assist in 2020, so he lost. In 2024, the assist was post-pandemic inflation which voters wrongly, but predictably, blamed on the incumbent administration.\n\nShe lost because the bigotry had a side of economics with it.

Joe Biden is the singular reason Kamala Harris and Democrats lost.\u201d\n\nSome of the sharpest criticism was reserved for the party machine of concealing the truth about the outgoing president\u2019s mental fitness.\n\n\u201cWhy did Joe Biden hold on for as long as he did? He should have not concealed his (health) and dropped out a lot sooner,\u201d one party donor told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\u201cThe party lied to the American people about the cognitive health and fitness of the president,\u201d Bill Ackman, a longtime Democratic donor who endorsed Trump, added.\n\nBefore his untimely withdrawal from the contest, Mr Biden\u2019s cognitive abilities had been called into question by his debate performance versus Trump and a series of gaffes, including referring to Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d.\n\nHis delayed decision to step down left Ms Harris only 107 days between becoming the new Democratic nominee and election day.\n\nHowever, both her campaign and the White House were confident going into decision day.\n\nInternal polling by both camps suggested Ms Harris was on an upwards trajectory and only gaining new voters the longer the contest went on.\n\nCampaign emails to the most important backers emphasised a surprise poll showing Ms Harris up in the state of Iowa as the main reason for their confidence, sources told the Telegraph.\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/joe-biden-cling-on-white-house-cost-harris-election/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/joe-biden-cling-on-white-house-cost-harris-election/)",
            "In the rest of the world \"left\" means fighting for the working class. American democrats have proclaimed themselves \"centrists\"  and defending any minority they can suck votes out of is now their platform. \n\nThis has become wokeism and obviously it isn't selling very well.  Moving to the center was supposed to get more  votes. What went wrong?",
            "Surely you're not arguing that the Joe Biden you see today would still be fit to be president in 2028.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nFor the record, I don't think Trump is either. But that's not what the Democratic Party was selling. They tried to sell\u00a0\"Listen, we beat Medicare\" as fit for the presidency for four more years.",
            "> For the record, I don't think Trump is either.\n\nExactly.  Fitness for office is a concern for elite snobs.  The other half of the electorate does not care.  \n\nWhen Biden stepped down the wiser if worse option would have been to replace him with another white male.  Trump is the worst candidate, but he'll beat a woman in an election in this country every time.  Because sexism. Did not beat Biden when he was the incumbent. \n\nGen Z, and especially Gen X males broke for Trump in a big way. (I feel personally ashamed of that as I am Gen X.)  I could make a solid argument that Biden was not the best candidate to get Trump out of office, but everybody knew we would need to run a white male.  That's just the emotional landscape of this country. And the less white populations are not less macho. \n\nAnd you'll hear it over and over from women who did not vote for her, \"I'm fine with a woman president, but not _that_ woman.\"   Even though that woman is extremely qualified and is really an excellent candidate to the book readers.  \n\nWe want it to be complicated, but I think the glaring lesson from this election is that people in large numbers are not complicated.  They don't go by facts and details and policy, they go by emotion.  Pride, fear, anxiety, security, etc.  Agent K had it right. \"A person is smart, you can talk to a person. But people are dumb, panicky animals, and you know it.\" \n\nAnd that really, really fucking sucks."

But maybe they just value cheating in and of itself and they feel like it can't be a proper election without cheating.\n\nBut if they just put the same kind of massive effort into improving things for people as they do cheating - then they wouldn't need to cheat.  The obvious conclusion then is that they not only enjoy cheating, but that they feel like winning by cheating is better than winning through honest effort."

            "I can agree with a lot of this. I too would like to see a country where conservatives and liberals and everyone in between can actually try to get along with one another as opposed to hating each other and self-segregating. \n\nHowever, the one big thing that needs to happen is the right-wing needs to grow up and accept reality. They need to finally accept that this mythical vision of the USA they cling to is never going to happen, and it shouldn't ever happen. \n\nThey need to wake up and stop thinking that the free market is going to fix everything in our lives, and realize much of those working the free market are out for the profit motive over anything else, including the safety and happiness of their employees and even their customers. That you're going to have to have some government in your life so that average people are not thrown under the bus by this extreme version of capitalism that runs the USA right now. \n\nThey need to wake up and accept that young men and women are not going to abstain until marriage, get married, crank out a few kids, and then the husband goes off to a good paying job while the wife voluntarily stays home and serves the husband. It's not even the idea that people have rejected those values, they just look at the world around them and feel it's financially impossible to have that kind of life. That things are going to have to deeply change on a societal level and stop telling the youth to just work harder. \n\nThey need to wake up and accept that there's never going to be a day where homosexuality and transgenderism are made 100% illegal and people have the right to oppress those groups. They also need to accept that the mass majority of this country does not want theology of any kind running the legislature. \n\nThey also need to wake up and accept that you're not going to somehow segregate the country to a degree that white people are going to be able to stay in homogenous areas and live free of any kind of ethnic minorities around them. \n\nThe left and the middle have been wanting to get the country more united and everybody living with each other and our subtle differences in ideologies keep the extremes from happening. Unfortunately, the right wing dove off the deep end with Nixon and they've been going down that hole more and more until now. \n\nSo yes, we can not rub it in their faces, not spit in their faces, not be mean to them, not make them feel lower, but they're going to have to wake up and join reality. If they're just going to hand us four to eight more years of Fox News rhetoric and then find someone just as Trump to run in 2028 and 2032, then there's going to have to be a point that we're going to start really going above and beyond to destroy everything and anything they keep hanging on to till they finally accept that they're never going to get this mythical World they want so badly.",
            "Step one: Republicans must join the reality-based community. There was no election fraud, nothing was stolen, the insurrection is a real thing that happened, and those convicted of crimes there should serve out their sentences. Post-birth abortion isn't a thing. Crime is down, not up, and has nothing to do with immigrants. Nobody is eating the dogs. Our economy is the envy of the world right now. \n\nIf you're going to live in an alternate reality, I don't see where the common ground is. If I say the sky is blue and you say it's red, that doesn't make it purple. Come back to reality. Try to pursue your goals within our democratic system instead of trying to thwart it. It is step one on the journey to reunification, and your side must take it.",

I think that anyone who feels that way should then take Harris's advice and [advocate for](https://books.google.com/books?id=cYgV-xh0SsAC&pg=PA28&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false):\n\n> ... workers may not have the funds that would enable them to take advantage of the potential gains from moving to higher-skilled employment, and offsetting policies would have to be implemented to limit the negative effects of immigration on the low-skilled native-born workers.\n\nSo we need free education for all!"

Even NPR does more and better.  Add to that the fact that these papers use paywalls to ensure their good reporting doesn't get shared that much, and isn't accessible to most people.  And the New York Times in particular has been low quality on average for a couple of decades now, extremely gullible and deferring to authority and missing reality in HUGE ways - like completely falling for the obvious bunk Bush and Cheney were promoting about Iraq's supposed nuclear and biological weapons and reporting on that stuff as if it was real when their sources showed otherwise.  They've continued like that to the present, where even in the past few months their editors seem to have been removing reporters' references to Trump's mental decline from articles, and rewriting headlines to sanewash his gibberish.\n\nAt least now the wave of cancellations of Washington Post subscriptions is, itself, making news, and that could do some good.\n\nTake your money away from these papers and send it to organizations that are really committed to investigative reporting and don't put it behind paywalls where it can't compete with the low-effort right wing propaganda outlets.",

            "Hey all, thanks for reading. James Carville, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns, explains in a guest essay why Kamala Harris will be president:\n\n\"The biggest reason Mr. Trump will lose is that the whole Republican Party has been on a losing streak since Mr. Trump took it over,\" writes James. \"Since joining the race, the vice president has raised an\u00a0eye-boggling $1 billion, and last quarter one of her fund-raising committees reeled\u00a0in $633\u00a0million \u2014 dwarfing what Mr. Trump raised with two committees combined. All this cash not only effectively offsets the flow of money funneling in for Mr. Trump from some\u00a0tech billionaires, but it has also given Ms. Harris the resources she needs to persuade swing voters with ads and to organize on the ground.\"\n\nRead the rest of the essay\u00a0[here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/opinion/kamala-harris-win-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.HD4e.giigO_RmjlyN&smid=re-nytopinion), without a subscription to The New York Times."

Chump will definitely start sending out tweets and putting it in his rally speeches. \n\nWhen Don the Con became president, it almost instantly started to rise Bush's standing as a president. Now he's the imp who passes candy to Michelle Obama at memorial services and shares his luxury box with Ellen Degeneres. \n\nOne other possible reason might simply be he is trying to time it for maximum impact. Republicans, particularly older ones, are well known for voting in person. So maybe Bush will be \"the\" October surprise, endorsing Harris a week or two before the election.",

And even if they somehow screwed that up without malice (which I don't believe for a nanosecond), the fact that it's only wrong on SOME ballots shows that ballots for the same offices in the same election are different when there's no reason for them to be, which implies some fuckery.

            "I'm staying optimistic and disagreeing. Everyone wants to relate this election to 2016 with Clinton, but I see a lot more excitement and enthusiasm toward Harris. The sentiment for a lot in 2016 seemed to be that Hillary was a shoe-in so it was safe to just stay home and expect her to win. After four years of Trump as president - not to mention just a decade of having to hear about him nonstop in general - Dems seem energized to vote in as great of numbers as possible and give Trump the most resounding political deathblow possible. I hope the enthusiasm I see online and in the real world carries over to the polls, but I genuinely feel that a lot of Dems have learned a valuable lesson on voting over these past 10 years. Biden had immense turn-out, and that was a candidate that a lot of people were just getting their teeth and voting against Trump for, but people seem actually excited about Harris, rather than just throwing a vote against Trump no matter who."

            "The smart money says the 2024 US presidential election hinges on the financial concerns of swing voters in battleground states.\n\nAnd sooner or later, when\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0takes a temporary break from his\u00a0ridiculous grievances, he may succeed in focusing the election debate in this direction.\n\nSo how would Harris answer the lethal question that Ronald Reagan posed to viewers during the final presidential debate with President Jimmy Carter in 1980: \u201cAre you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d Back then, the electorate answered \u201dno\u201d and put Reagan in power.\n\nIt\u2019s not really a fair question \u2013 least of all in 2024 after the American economy, like all other major economies, has spent the previous three years recovering from the inflation shock caused by the\u00a0Ukraine war\u00a0and the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe latter event, exacerbated by Trump\u2019s ineptitude, saw the Biden administration hand out billions in pandemic relief. This largesse was not sustainable for long. It\u2019s been sorely missed by working- and middle-class families.\n\nThe myth of Trump\u2019s financial acumen still persists in the minds of many Americans, despite his list of failed businesses and a record in government of tax cuts for the super-rich that caused the\u00a0national debt\u00a0to spiral by $7.8trn (\u00a35.9tn).\n\nEconomic growth under Trump was nothing special. If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation\u00a0averaged 2.67 per cent\u00a0under Trump, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. So far, under\u00a0[Joe Biden](https://inews.co.uk/topic/joe-biden?ico=in-line_link), annual growth is averaging 3.4 per cent.\n\nBut people have short memories. And here are some of the numbers giving\u00a0[Kamala Harris](https://inews.co.uk/topic/kamala-harris?ico=in-line_link)\u00a0nightmares:\n\n* \\* 9 \u2013 the percentage at which inflation peaked in 2023, and the highest in four decades\n* \\* 34 \u2013 the percentage of Americans who say they live\u00a0paycheck to paycheck.\n* \\* 69 \u2013 the preliminary consumer confidence reading for September in the\u00a0University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index\u00a0(CSI). Successful presidential candidates typically score 90 per cent or more.\n\nNews this month suggests Harris is\u00a0closing\u00a0the gap\u00a0on Trump regarding the public\u2019s confidence in her economic competence, and that she is managing to distance herself from the blame attached to Biden\u2019s handling of the country\u2019s finances.\n\nBut even in this survey more respondents thought they would be better off financially if Trump were re-elected, with 40 per cent saying they would either be somewhat or much better off under his presidency compared with 35 per cent who thought they would be better off under Harris.\n\nThe fact is many Americans were still no better off than they were in the last pre-pandemic year, 2019, a fact highlighted last week by the\u00a0United States Census Bureau.\n\nInflation-adjusted household income in 2023 stands at $80,610 (\u00a361,236) \u2013 a little lower than its 2019 level of\u00a0$81,210 (\u00a361,692). The gap is worse though, if you look at real income after taxes (and tax credits), which better reflects what households were actually able to spend. Incomes actually increased during Covid shutdowns, thanks to government handouts. But when these ended, real income after taxes dropped significantly.",
            "\u201cThis is one of the biggest reasons that Democrats have struggled to sell Americans on the merits of President Joe Biden\u2019s economic stewardship,\u201d a\u00a0*Washington Post*\u00a0editorial noted last week. \u201cMs Harris should be honest about that decline, while also explaining why the 2020 and 2021 figures weren\u2019t sustainable, and why there\u00a0are still lots of reasons to think the economy is strong and capable of getting stronger.\u201d\n\nMajor financial news this week might give Harris the opportunity to tackle the subject head on \u2013 and set the agenda. The Federal Reserve is expected to finally\u00a0announce\u00a0a cut in interest rates today, with Wall Street betting on a significant half-point cut.\n\nThis is Harris\u2019s chance to tell voters that the economy\u00a0has turned a corner. An interest rate cut will lower mortgage costs for homeowners. The rate cut is made possible by a slowing economy, but on the plus side, inflation has now fallen to 2.5 per cent.\n\nSo far, her economic promises have centred on tax policy. She has talked about\u00a0expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 (\u00a34,558) bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 (\u00a318,991) first-time homebuyer tax credit and end to taxes on waiters\u2019 tips. In contrast to Trump, Harris has pledged to raise corporate tax from 21 per cent to 28 per cent. Her opponent wants to lower it to 15 per cent.\n\nHarris doesn\u2019t have any great economic ideas and her grasp of the subject has left most pundits unimpressed. And some experts are puzzled\u00a0over Trump\u2019s failure to exploit her vulnerabilities on the economy.\n\n\u201cTrump hasn\u2019t kept a relentless focus on the issue by tying Harris to big government programmes that overheated the US economy,\u201d says Thomas Gift, director of the UCL Centre on US Politics. \u201cNor has he made a convincing case that some of Harris\u2019s new policy proposals \u2013 from anti-price gouging laws to subsidies for first-time homeowners \u2013 would only make the economic situation for many Americans worse.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a degree of irony that Biden, from whom Harris would like to create some distance due to the cost of living\u00a0crisis, has put the US economy on firm footing for the years ahead. The investment that Biden\u00a0piled into infrastructure and clean energy\u00a0already is reaping dividends for the US economy, which has emerged from the Covid-Ukraine double whammy better than any other Western country.\n\nAs the\u00a0*FT*\u2019s Edward Luce notes, Harris \u201cis handicapped by her inability to distance herself too much from\u00a0Bidenomics, which remains unpopular even though its track record is pretty good\u201d.\n\nHarris has talked about an \u201copportunity economy\u201d. But no one really knows what this means, given her hodge-podge of proposals from child tax credits\u00a0and Soviet-sounding price controls to watered-down capital gains tax hikes on the wealthy.",
            "Harris might benefit from a blunt attack on the nonsensical aspects of her opponent\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s vow to slap\u00a0enormous tariffs\u00a0(up to 60 per cent) on imports from China would push up inflation and risk the jobs of the millions of US workers who supply overseas manufacturers with goods and services.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem to realise that US consumers pay the tariffs, not the foreign exporters.\n\nThe man who still touted the\u00a0\u201cArt of the Deal\u201d seems even less versed in economics than his Democratic opponent.\n\nHarris\u2019s best bet would probably be telling the electorate what they want to hear, without insulting their intelligence. Inflation IS down, interest rates are falling, things are getting better after some tough years. And the\u00a0return of Trump\u00a0risks taking America back to chaos and joblessness. If she says it long enough and loud enough, it might get through.\n\n\u201cI think she\u00a0will continue with the message that the economy is improving but the middle class still needs help paying for housing, groceries and medical care,\u201d says Todd Belt, a professor of political science at George Washington University. \u201cShe then will pivot to talking about her plans. It\u2019s risky to look like she\u2019s resting on the laurels of an improving economy without empathising with people dealing with high prices.\u201d\n\nBut that won\u2019t happen if she shies away from\u00a0the subject and journalists\u2019 questions. With just seven weeks to go, it might be now or never for Harris to make her case this week on the economy\n\nRead more on i: [https://inews.co.uk/news/world/numbers-kamala-harris-nightmares-how-turn-around-3281472](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/numbers-kamala-harris-nightmares-how-turn-around-3281472)"

A letter from Jackie Singh, the  cybersecurity lead for the Biden-Harris 2020 campaign, has added weight to growing calls for a forensic audit of the 2024 US presidential election.",

With judge approval, they could tap any phone, seize any electronics, intercept any communications or collect any evidence they needed. The opportunity to uncover any plot to steal the election was before and during the election. It is too late to do anything now. There was some speculation that this was happening when the FBI raided (legally searched and seized equipment with a judge\u2019s approval) PolyMarket. However, nothing else has happened and the president and Harris campaign seem completely willing to hand the government over to these monsters. Personally, I\u2019d have launched a counter intelligence operation in my first year to make sure Trump and any other Russian assets were arrested and charged but Joe didn\u2019t want the appearance of going after political rivals and chose the legal system approach. We saw how that went.",

Though back-ass as hell, was a plan for a growing illegal migration and a growing economic issue. 'Stay in Mexico?' Where Trump was literally paying 1/100th of what it takes to house migrants here, was housing, feeding, and clothing migrants while they got citizenship? An actually good plan. The froo-froo feel good legislation names full of back-alley deals attached as Riders pissed off a ton of people also, especially when it was discovered that one of these riders, attached by the Democrat Party removed 'Drinkable Water' from a basic list of human rights so that cities could ignore the failing public water systems for beautification efforts.\n\nAnd no, a declaration of \"We're not switching to Electric Cars!\", for example, is not a plan. A plan looks like this: 1: Identify a problem. 2: Identify what changes need to be made. 3. A declaration of how you are going to fix said problem.\n\nAlso, enough about 'Global Warming' or 'Assisting (Identity Group).' Focus on things that matter to the perspective of your constituents in their daily life. Including: 1: Fixing our undrinkable tap water issues. 2: Bringing Jobs back to America. 3: Getting K-12 Schools focused on making people employable after graduation. 4: Getting necessities to modern life (Food, Energy, Homes) back to where we can afford them. Once the constituents lives are actually back to normal, once we can actually afford homes/food/gas, people will care about that kinda stuff again (except maybe Global Warming. If the scientists were right, we'd have died back in 2000.)",

Carter and Bush senior lost their re-election bids because the economy polled badly with voters.\n  \nAnd despite being her own person with her own message, Kamala Harris was never able to represent something beyond the incumbent status quo to enough voters.\n  \nAny government where 30 to 50M of their citizens live in poverty and nobody can remember a time when the country wasn't getting worse is at serious risk of overthrow.  Hindsight may show us that a popularist uprising was inevitable, but the right did it first.",

Remember, Hitler won his first election because he was presenting plans to help the German People after an ineffectual government let the people suffer a major economic depression.",
            "No, she lost because she presented no plans. Nobody could answer what her policies, positions, or plans for her Presidency. Trump, however, did.\n\nAs for the Campaign, it was horrible. It felt like they were saying 'Vote for her becauise she's got Melanin and a VaJayJay.' In times where the economy's fine and infrastructure's not failing, where people can drink from the faucets, go get food from a store, own a house and at least one car? That would be okay. However, her campaign felt like that cartoon pannel of the dog in the flaming house saying 'This is Fine' while America is burning down around her.\n\nThis happened in 2016 also. Every Hillary, in 2016, and Kamala, in 2024, Campaign Office I visited couldn't tell me thing one about: plans to help the economy, plans to fix our failing infrastructures, plans to convert to clean energy without disrupting energy consumption, plans to help house and feed the growing migrant population, how to improve public schools, etc. \n\nRemember this for 2028: People would sooner follow the village idiot if they have a plan, than the smartest person in the room if they're pretty much just shrugging and say \"I've got nothing. Lets just wing it.\"",

They wanted him. They voted for him in the primary. They were excited to vote for him in the General.\n\nThe Democrats told primary voters to screw off and appointed Biden, even though they knew he was in sharp decline. No need for the party voters to get involved, though!  Then they appointed a candidate who polled at 0% among Democrats when she ran in 2020 and dropped out before the first primary..\n\nI kinda feel like explanations that eschew this angle are incomplete. Trump voters WANTED to vote for Trump. For as hard as the left worked to gaslight us into thinking they were super pumped about Kamala, they were not. And I don't blame them, after how the DNC did them.",

In the end it's all about the money.\n\nEDIT: I am using speech to text and it will sometimes capitalize words for reasons that I don't understand. It appears that it capitalized the word truth in my first sentence above and because of this I'm being accused of sending out subtle signals to true believers of the president elect.

            "No, no, and no. The fatal flaw in both 2016 and 2024 is the Democrats ignoring 1 simple thing: Plans make the masses feel good. Hillary's campaign was not presenting plans for the problems America faced. Neither was Kamala's. Sure, they talk about global warming, and the plights of all the identity/minority groups, but here's the problem with that: The AVERAGE VOTER only cares about those things when they've got lots of extra spending money, fresh drinkable water coming in through their pipes, and can afford to buy a house/new car instead of being stuck permarenting/taking public transport. These are status symbols, and America loves status symbols. Why do you think the brand new video game systems are bought out before release day even happens? Because, even though there may be only a handfull of titles at launch, and most people tend to go back to the old systems for a while unless there's backwards compatability... unless one or more of the new systems' games is like a Ghosts of Tsushima, is because of the status that having the newest/best brings. Since the Bush Administration, America has declined to the point where America has grown lean enough on these things to make people latch onto ANY plan to return to the financial 'good old days' of the 1990s.\n\nAs for being ineligible... no he was still eligible. And here's why:\n\n1: Trump was never convicted of insurrection.\n\n2. The legal process in New York was not completed. If New York could have gotten that win, and gotten all the appeals out of the way, BEFORE parties could file paperwork for candidates to start primarying, yes. However, New York was too little, too late. Before someone can get stricken from the ability to run for office over felonies, the entire legal process has to play out.",

He is at best a carnival sideshow Barker. The problem you have, and it seems most people on your side have, is an inability to take an objective look at the facts and ask yourself what might actually be going on. \n\nMaybe it's just me but I find it hysterical that the party that went on and on about democracy, and how important democracy is, and we've got to protect democracy has for three election cycles now not really held real primaries, 2016 and 2020 were fixed. And 2024 for the most part they were canceled. They were even sued in Florida and the courts sided with them saying saying that we're private party and could do whatever they wanted as far as selecting their nominee. Then when what had been obvious to anybody with eyes and ears for months was exposed to be beyond the truth at a poorly run debate and the candidate stepped out, was there any sort of democratic process too choose the next nominee or were they anointed? \n\nAlthough they control both houses of Congress the majority in the house is so slim it might as well be a 50/50 tie.

            "No, the Fatal Flaw was that Trump had Dirt on Nancy Pelosi and most of the old timers he was going to release if the Insurrection Trial continued to play out. This is WHY we need term limits. America is pretty blase towards corruption, but only to a point. After about 12 years (2 senate terms or 3 terms in the House), about 90-95% of modern politicians hit a level of perceived corruption even Americans find abhorrent. Perceived as in, I could make a claim and enough Americans will believe it. Look at Alex Jones' Adrenochrome claims. Believable because we've got enough old people who've been in congress 30, 40, even 50 years that people believe they'd do ANYTHING to continue to hold onto power. Which, in some cases on both sides of the aisle, is true. FFS, Nesle, our largest bottled water maker, has paid both political parties to rule that Clean Drinking WATER was not a human right.\n\nThat said...\n\nThe biggest flaws are something that nobody's willing to look at: Overconfidence. The Democratic Party believes it's own hype. In my state, they actually believed that Kamala could win by playing the \"I've got a vagina and melanin\" card. Like the Kamala Ads here came just short of her appearing on screen and literally saying this. Their campaign offices couldn't answer a single question about her political stances, and were pompous assholes with a superiority complex. They act like the tactics that worked when America was financially fine, when most people could worry about things besides \"How am I going to feed/clothe/shelter myself/my family\" would still work.

You also can't continue to keep insulting the electorate and believe it is going to help you politically.

Trump's always taken his message to the people through low-brow means which works because most Americans are fucking stupider than you fucking give them fucking credit for and low brow entertainment to them is the equivalent to Opera or the Ballet to the cultured.\n\nSo pull your head out of your ass. Because the stupid far outnumber the smart in this country, and you guys practically alienate them by ignoring them and sticking to your base in Academia. Where was Kamala's \"Michelle Obama on Ellen\" moment? Americans have not fucking changed since Baby Bush took office. The only thing smart about us are our mouths and phones. FFS, At least Obama knew to fucking pander to the masses.",
            "I'm not really sure what capitalization you're talking about, I'm using speech to text and it has an odd habit of capitalizing words that it shouldn't. Also and I suppose given your limited intellect you haven't noticed this but I've never once referred to anyone by name. I do not speak that name. If somewhere the word truth got capitalized I had nothing to do with it and I am certainly not a part of that delusional group of people. \n\nBelieve what you want to believe, I'm telling you you're wrong. I don't know anyone that is pro the president elect that is not vocally pro. Certainly on social media where you can be anonymous and say even crazier things than you might in real life, though given my experience with the delusional I know that this is not true. And of course that applies to both sides. \n\nYou have been propaganda eyes ( right there is a speech to text thing, rather than propagandized, it said propaganda eyes, what you got to admit is pretty funny) to the point where you are only able to see people through one of two filters. If you don't want to open your eyes and try to understand things on your own there's nothing I can do to help you. However there are so many excellent sources online from both sides that will give you enough good relevant information that you can make up your own mind about things within without having to goose step to your parties marching orders. \n\nJust think of all the people that went around spending the better part of the week scolding people over the pronunciation of the vice president's name. And telling the American public that if they did not pronounce it the proper way they were either misogynist or racist or worse. Then you can go look for video of these same people pronouncing her name half a dozen different ways. How ridiculous is that? Is that really how you're going to gain the upper hand in the political Battle of what was said to be a lifetime, and now even the president of the United States is brushing off with well we'll get them next time. \n\nYou're actually unable to engage in any kind of discussion of the issues because all you can do is call people names. Basically you don't really know anything other than what you've been propagandized with and apparently you're unable to even repeat that short of just saying you're a supporter you're a supporter and it doesn't matter that you say you're not because I know that you are, please...\n\n\nEDIT: okay, I found the capitalization that you were so worried about, I'm going to give it to you on that one, that it would seem to be a hidden message to the faithful. Once again you can believe what you want to or not but I have not so much as downloaded the app. Anything I have ever seen from it has been posted in a news article.

            "You want to win the white house then you need somebody who is millennial to appeal to the largest voting cohort, you need somebody who is male to alleviate the misogynistic tendency of boomers and gen X. And somebody who is why to alleviate the racism inherent in older generations. As well as straight to alleviate the homophobia that is pretty rife in those same generations.\n\n2028 is an pivot year in as much as the boomers will fall behind the millennials in eligible voters and with nearly 15 million fewer voting age people Gen X does have the heft that millenials do whilst Gen Z isn't old enough to run for the white house. What this means is that you want somebody in that age group to appeal to them and their concerns. Simultaneously you can't afford to turn off older voters because collectively Boomers and Gen X will have the majority over voting aged people until th 2032 election.\n\nRuben Gellego is the youngest on your list but he's still a Gen X.  My advice is find a younger candidate that fits those criteria first and then fits the Democrats platform second. Don't get me wrong these are all good candidate but if you want to win you want somebody who will be in the late thirties early forties come 2028.I don't make people's feelings but I do understand them and if you want to win you need to address those feelings both good and bad if you want to win with an understanding that people are at times more motivated by fear than by hope and the closer you get to a candidate that fits the ideal president of the electorate the more likely you are to win.\n\nSo while I agree that all of these candidates will make for an excellent short list for VP I also think you are failing to understand the personal biases that run in large swaths of the American electorate. You might personally not like it hell even I don't like it but it is there glaring you in the face every time you see Donald Trump in the white house. You want to win you need to understand those biases and play to them whether you personally like it or not. After all you can't change the direction of the nation if you don't win elections.",

            "My advice if you have any pull in the DNC is to get them focused on cheerleading candidates that fit the mold they need to win. Because you need more than just a straight white male in his late 30s and early 40s you also need somebody who is charismatic and that's a much harder thing to find. Though after the shit show that this next term of Trump is likely to run people may be in the mood for plain vanilla leave it to beaver kind of candidates we will know more in 4 years."

That demographic - men of various ages and ethnicities, felt snubbed, and they left the fence towards Trump.\n\nGoing on shows like 'The View' was only ever preaching to the choir.  It gained her almost nothing.\n\nIn hindsight, the whole thing was a disaster.  Biden should never have run for re-election, and the primary process is meant to test who can get organic support and win in the general election.  You can't skip that part.  Harris had run in 2020 and was never the leader or close to it, so she should not have been given that nomination in '24.\n\nThat misstep might be the end of democracy in America in our lifetime.

Many interviews from July to November might have done it.  \n\nThose bro-casts all disliked her because (supposedly) - her interviews were too vague and she wasn't answering questions to their satisfaction.  She should have been better about that.  Basically she was untested because there was no real primary.  This was the only way to get the undecideds.  She screwed it up.\n\nHonestly, she should never have gotten the nomination by proclamation that way.  We should have had debates and a short primary in July-August.

Now, we're firmly entrenched on the worst possible timeline.\n\nI disagree. In hindsight, the Dems should have let Trump cook himself into oblivion in a 2nd term. The Biden administration spent too much capital fixing the fallout from the pandemic that Trump fumbled and didn't even credit itself for navigating the US out of the 2020 shitshow. On top of that, they spent 4 years fruitlessly dispelling Trump's lies about the election being stolen and refused to hold him just as accountable for our current spell of inflation which has direct ties to rhe global supply chain hiccup due to the Pandemic. \n\nJoe Rogan has his fan base. They also lean heavily into MAGA and Alt-Right demagoguery more than institutional democracy. I watched his interview with Trump and it wasn't insightful at all from fixing inflation to explaining how more Tariffs are beneficial to maintain street USA. Never-ending all of outright lies Trump has pushed all these years, Rogan was more interested in UFOs.",

He obviously did not have dementia.  He was just   older, with all the frailties that brought.  And he was a great president.  But there was a 2+ year period when he was out of the public view, and that was during a time of high inflation and personal insecurity, where he should have been more visible, to give confidence.  In hindsight, it was a mistake on his part.\n\nAnother view is that discontent has been very high around the world, and almost all incumbent governments over the last 2-3 years have been replaced.  So maybe it was always hopeless.  The historians will argue about it.",

            "I agree with everything you\u2019re saying, but then I trip over blaming the Democratic Party for the wildly stupid decision made by American voters. Could the Democrats have done anything better, was there some inflection point along the way where a zig would have been better than a zag? Certainly. \n\nBut their opponent was Donald Goddamned Trump. There he was, farting his way through his criminal convictions, bragging about molesting teenage beauty pageant contestants, obviously lacking in even the vaguest notion of how anything works, and enjoying the fruits of embezzling billions from the office the last time he served. Why doesn\u2019t he need to do anything right ever? In fact, what gives anybody confidence that doing things *right* is what these voters even wanted? The democrats could have run a flawless campaign and lost by *more*. \n\nI would be unwilling to extend any excuses to the American voters for choosing this game show host over even the most incompetent of all Democratic campaigns or incumbents. They wanted the idiot, everyone tried their best to talk them out of it, and we are all gonna pay dearly for their decision. I have no sympathy left over for them.",
            "Democracy may be a historic fluke.  Autocracy has been around much longer and in more parts of the world.  I'm not sure our normal standard will ever re-assert itself.  There are too many interest-groups that are constantly trying to undermine it.  The payoff for doing so successfully is in the 10's of $trillions of dollars, and also, the religious-zealots also get a mandate to stuff their zealotry at secular folks, which is their ultimate dream.  We may be on a path to be more like Lebanon with all its factions, or Syria, which has a 'president' with no pretense of legitimacy.  That's common in most of the world.  \n\nInflation from 2021-23 was a combined 18%, and the high interest-rates that were the remedy were also a very strong, painful medicine.   It was always an uphill battle, and most incumbent governments have fallen.  So we're back at 2017 again.\n\nThe strange thing is that - the whole economy is much more stable and faster-growing under Democrats.  You would think that the mogul-class would see that.  Where can they safely put their money, now that Trump will be destroying several industries out of pure spite over the next year?   We will very likely have a deep trade-war recession within the next year.  they are shooting themselves in both feet.   That's my sense of it."

The only way for a Democrat to win in this environment would be to run against the Biden administration as an outsider Democrat. Kamala couldn't have done that.

She didn't lose because she didn't go on Joe Rogan's idiotic podcast.\n\nIt was always going to be close because there are just that many American voters who really dig Trump's racism and misogyny. Maybe not enough of them to win without an assist, though. In 2016 that assist was James Comey and Vladimir Putin. There was no significant assist in 2020, so he lost. In 2024, the assist was post-pandemic inflation which voters wrongly, but predictably, blamed on the incumbent administration.\n\nShe lost because the bigotry had a side of economics with it.

It\u2019s so transparent what his particular appeal is, but a lot of people seem to be in denial. \n\nHere we are. \n\nNot much Democrats can do about it as a party or as candidates, unfortunately. \n\nIt will take a public that thinks better.",

            "In other words, if memory serves, the exact same reason she was the first dropout of the 2020 primary. I always thought that was a bit of a gamble for Biden to choose her when the Democrat party basically said they wanted anyone else and she dropped out before the primaries even started.",

            "She lost for two reasons, first Joe Bidens China policy hasn't really worked as much as achieving reciprocity and second inflation led many people to assume that Bidens domestic policy was failing even if the inflation rate has fallen back to normal.\n\nIt's hard to say which of those two issues had the bigger impact given just how much China's mercantilist policies impact the US economy. I'd give the China question a much much higher impact on the 2028 election as by that point the US and China are likely to be in a cold war state by then.\n\nAt any rate this shif was a referendum on the economy more than anything and I suspect it will be even more so given that Republicans are likely to mess up badly given how much of their policy is ideologically driven rather than fact based.\n\nWorse still this wasn't a major victory for the Republicans as they barely one. You look at the swing districts and there are now roughly 70 Republicans house members sitting in what is now swing districts where as the number of democrats on swing districts has fallen to about 30. In swing states there are now 20 Republican senators that could lose there seats if they crash the economy.\n\nAll in all the Republicans are in a worse position for victory then they have been since at least the Reagan administration and that doesn't bode well for them leading into the critical 2030 redistricting period after the census. Quite frankly the only thing worse for the Republicans than Donald Trump losing the election would be Donald Trump winning because now the Republicans are going to be in charge and responsible for the economic performance of the country at a time when the party is quite frankly full of dunderheads and zealots which historically has never ended well for sound and prudent policy.\n\nReality is that Republicans don't have a mandate for radical change like they seem to think they do and will likely pay a steep price if and likely when they screw up. Likely we will see a period of liberal growth in the US over the next decade that will be increasingly difficult for the Republicans to counter as they recover from Trumps second term. Republicans are on a very short leash and if they start yank on that cord to chase after there ideology squirrel whilst they fail the economic aspirations of the American voter the price the GOP pays will be decades of lost power.",

People have gotten tired of identity politics. \n3) She wasn't a popular candidate. \n4) The far left's Gaza protests, antisemitism, and college campus takeovers turned off many for voting for Democrats.\n5) Joe Biden cut out too late.\n6) She couldn't talk.\n7) Stupid wokeness.

            "This is what *absolutely* kills me. WE ARE BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. And yet, the Dems couldn't even nail down that message. All they had to do was remind people how absolutely *dire* things were. Four years ago, life was bleak. But no\u2014no one bothered to hammer that point home. Instead, they let people with memories shorter than a TikTok clip completely forget it. How can people be so blind to the facts? They obsess over the price of eggs and gas, stare at their paychecks, and shout, \"This doesn't add up! Must be all Biden's fault!\" Meanwhile, corporate America is raking in record profits, laughing all the way to the bank. Takes no blame. But the media won\u2019t touch that, will they? No\u2014they\u2019re too busy stoking outrage to do their damn jobs.  And Kamala wouldn't touch it either, the fucking corporatist shill.\n\nOh don't even get me started on the Harris campaign. When confronted with the *simplest* question\u2014are we better off?\u2014they just ran away from it. Couldn't even back up their own administration. They practically implied Biden messed up and they\u2019d do things differently, like they\u2019re some kind of *opposition within the administration*. Here\u2019s an idea: stand up, and say you're going to regulate corporate price gouging and tell people why tariffs and tax cuts for the rich are going to be a disaster. Lay it out! Even Trump\u2019s alma mater said he\u2019s economically inept. But no, they had to keep validating the tired narrative that Biden\u2019s a failure and there\u2019s some magical fix they\u2019re holding onto. *Pathetic.*\n\nBiden shouldn\u2019t have run again, full stop. The party needed a primary, a real choice. Kamala would\u2019ve lost it fair and square if that\u2019s how it went, and maybe, just maybe, we\u2019d have ended up with a stronger message. This whole setup is one massive misfire, fueled by a country full of people who can\u2019t see past their own wallets and a media machine that\u2019s greedily fanning the flames of ignorance. It\u2019s maddening. Honestly? We probably deserve whatever\u2019s coming.",

All whilst Donald Trump is in charge and likely the cause of many of those crisis.\n\nWith the US and global economy in a much more fragile state then when Trump took over in 2016 it's doubtful we are in a position to wheather the hamfist approach to economic, social, political and foreign policies that Donald Trump is going to implement. I'd say bend over and spread those butt cheeks because were all about to get screwed over and screwed over badly.\n\nPersonally I'm considering selling my home buy gold and moving to Latin America and kicking it on the beach for the next decade. If we avoid world war 3 I'll be shocked but I doubt we will avoid cold war 2.0 and that's going to spark off a prolonged period of volatility at the bear minimum.\n\nI wonder what all those Trump voters in swing states are going to say come 2028?

You see them leading the mob\u2019s march with battle cries such as \u201cThis is the second f----ng revolution\u201d and \u201cTrump\u2019s coming!\u201d.\n\nAs a result, some footage from the documentary played a key role in the congressional committee\u2019s investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s role in the\u00a0[attempt to overturn the election](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/02/trump-allegations-live-new-court-filings-released/), and Quested himself was summoned as a witness. The film premiered to 20 million viewers when it was screened across most of the major United States television networks.\n\nThe shadow of that January day still looms large on the US body politic.\u00a0[Vice President Kamala Harris](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/29/kamala-harris-ellipse-washington-dc-rally-us-election/)\u00a0recently delivered her closing election argument on the Ellipse, where Trump held his Stop the Steal rally preceding the Capitol insurrection. In contrast, Quested has made an unlikely, unsolicited entrance into the US political arena.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve basically worked as a foreign correspondent since 2011,\u201d says Quested when we meet in his offices in downtown Manhattan just a week before the US election. \u201cMaking films in some of the most contested areas of the world for National Geographic, whether it\u2019s Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Mexico or Guatemala. It\u2019s discomfiting now to find myself \\[covering similar civil disorder\\] in the country I live in.\u201d\n\nThe executive director of Goldcrest Films, Quested, 54, is best known for his work with lauded American writer Sebastian Junger \u2013 including\u00a0*Restrepo*, the 2010 Oscar-nominated documentary film about a platoon in Afghanistan, and\u00a0*Hell on Earth*\u00a0about Syria and Isis. But he first made his name in hip-hop circles, directing music videos for the likes of Common, Dr Dre and the now disgraced\u00a0[P Diddy](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/diddy-scandal-who-is-involved/).\n\nPersonable and engaging, the film-maker is dressed in sports casual attire.

But maybe they just value cheating in and of itself and they feel like it can't be a proper election without cheating.\n\nBut if they just put the same kind of massive effort into improving things for people as they do cheating - then they wouldn't need to cheat.  The obvious conclusion then is that they not only enjoy cheating, but that they feel like winning by cheating is better than winning through honest effort."

As of last month, every one of the 90 federal agencies that employs law enforcement officers, consistent with relevant collective bargaining agreements, has reported into NLEAD as required by the Executive Order. The database contains 5,300 records covering misconduct for more than 4,300 past and present federal officers over the last 7 years.  There are currently more than 150,000 law enforcement officers across the federal government.\n\nNLEAD is being used regularly.

Why would you turn away migrants that want to move here and find a life? Our nation is BECAUSE of immigration and finding a better life.\n\nCrime - I do believe violent crime is down, it might not seem that way in this charged-up election cycle though, but consider some of the things a certain candidate often talks about. I think with the advent of these wire-taps we all carry around certain crimes are rather low and others may have risen (cybercrimes).\n\nAs for the cost-of-living: a certain candidate took a dump on our nation economically, socially, spiritually, and in the case of some of his more extreme followers, physically. Harris\u2019 economic policies in regard to business, home ownership, fertility, and healthcare would be an enormous boon to the nation and We the People.\n\nI believe that the past decade has been a learning experience for everyone.

            "She lost because too many people are stupid and think that WH occupants determine grocery and housing prices and should therefore be blamed when they feel too high.   It\u2019s happened to societies all over the world after the COVID-induced inflation gripped all developed countries.   I doubt that any US incumbent could have won.  And it saddens me to say it, but I think there\u2019s a disturbing number of people, Dems included, who don\u2019t want a woman of color to have the highest office.   Harris ran a great campaign.

Though back-ass as hell, was a plan for a growing illegal migration and a growing economic issue. 'Stay in Mexico?' Where Trump was literally paying 1/100th of what it takes to house migrants here, was housing, feeding, and clothing migrants while they got citizenship? An actually good plan. The froo-froo feel good legislation names full of back-alley deals attached as Riders pissed off a ton of people also, especially when it was discovered that one of these riders, attached by the Democrat Party removed 'Drinkable Water' from a basic list of human rights so that cities could ignore the failing public water systems for beautification efforts.\n\nAnd no, a declaration of \"We're not switching to Electric Cars!\", for example, is not a plan. A plan looks like this: 1: Identify a problem. 2: Identify what changes need to be made. 3. A declaration of how you are going to fix said problem.\n\nAlso, enough about 'Global Warming' or 'Assisting (Identity Group).' Focus on things that matter to the perspective of your constituents in their daily life. Including: 1: Fixing our undrinkable tap water issues. 2: Bringing Jobs back to America. 3: Getting K-12 Schools focused on making people employable after graduation. 4: Getting necessities to modern life (Food, Energy, Homes) back to where we can afford them. Once the constituents lives are actually back to normal, once we can actually afford homes/food/gas, people will care about that kinda stuff again (except maybe Global Warming. If the scientists were right, we'd have died back in 2000.)",

Hindsight may show us that a popularist uprising was inevitable, but the right did it first.",

Remember, Hitler won his first election because he was presenting plans to help the German People after an ineffectual government let the people suffer a major economic depression.",
            "No, she lost because she presented no plans. Nobody could answer what her policies, positions, or plans for her Presidency. Trump, however, did.\n\nAs for the Campaign, it was horrible. It felt like they were saying 'Vote for her becauise she's got Melanin and a VaJayJay.' In times where the economy's fine and infrastructure's not failing, where people can drink from the faucets, go get food from a store, own a house and at least one car? That would be okay. However, her campaign felt like that cartoon pannel of the dog in the flaming house saying 'This is Fine' while America is burning down around her.\n\nThis happened in 2016 also. Every Hillary, in 2016, and Kamala, in 2024, Campaign Office I visited couldn't tell me thing one about: plans to help the economy, plans to fix our failing infrastructures, plans to convert to clean energy without disrupting energy consumption, plans to help house and feed the growing migrant population, how to improve public schools, etc. \n\nRemember this for 2028: People would sooner follow the village idiot if they have a plan, than the smartest person in the room if they're pretty much just shrugging and say \"I've got nothing. Lets just wing it.\"",

They wanted him. They voted for him in the primary. They were excited to vote for him in the General.\n\nThe Democrats told primary voters to screw off and appointed Biden, even though they knew he was in sharp decline. No need for the party voters to get involved, though!  Then they appointed a candidate who polled at 0% among Democrats when she ran in 2020 and dropped out before the first primary..\n\nI kinda feel like explanations that eschew this angle are incomplete. Trump voters WANTED to vote for Trump. For as hard as the left worked to gaslight us into thinking they were super pumped about Kamala, they were not. And I don't blame them, after how the DNC did them.",

In the end it's all about the money.\n\nEDIT: I am using speech to text and it will sometimes capitalize words for reasons that I don't understand. It appears that it capitalized the word truth in my first sentence above and because of this I'm being accused of sending out subtle signals to true believers of the president elect. LOL, this is the height of TDS, although I have to admire someone who is such a propagandized individual that they picked up on it and called it out",

            "No, no, and no. The fatal flaw in both 2016 and 2024 is the Democrats ignoring 1 simple thing: Plans make the masses feel good. Hillary's campaign was not presenting plans for the problems America faced. Neither was Kamala's. Sure, they talk about global warming, and the plights of all the identity/minority groups, but here's the problem with that: The AVERAGE VOTER only cares about those things when they've got lots of extra spending money, fresh drinkable water coming in through their pipes, and can afford to buy a house/new car instead of being stuck permarenting/taking public transport. These are status symbols, and America loves status symbols. Why do you think the brand new video game systems are bought out before release day even happens? Because, even though there may be only a handfull of titles at launch, and most people tend to go back to the old systems for a while unless there's backwards compatability... unless one or more of the new systems' games is like a Ghosts of Tsushima, is because of the status that having the newest/best brings. Since the Bush Administration, America has declined to the point where America has grown lean enough on these things to make people latch onto ANY plan to return to the financial 'good old days' of the 1990s.\n\nAs for being ineligible... no he was still eligible. And here's why:\n\n1: Trump was never convicted of insurrection.\n\n2. The legal process in New York was not completed. If New York could have gotten that win, and gotten all the appeals out of the way, BEFORE parties could file paperwork for candidates to start primarying, yes. However, New York was too little, too late. Before someone can get stricken from the ability to run for office over felonies, the entire legal process has to play out.",

He is at best a carnival sideshow Barker. The problem you have, and it seems most people on your side have, is an inability to take an objective look at the facts and ask yourself what might actually be going on. \n\nMaybe it's just me but I find it hysterical that the party that went on and on about democracy, and how important democracy is, and we've got to protect democracy has for three election cycles now not really held real primaries, 2016 and 2020 were fixed. And 2024 for the most part they were canceled. They were even sued in Florida and the courts sided with them saying saying that we're private party and could do whatever they wanted as far as selecting their nominee. Then when what had been obvious to anybody with eyes and ears for months was exposed to be beyond the truth at a poorly run debate and the candidate stepped out, was there any sort of democratic process too choose the next nominee or were they anointed? \n\nAlthough they control both houses of Congress the majority in the house is so slim it might as well be a 50/50 tie. It actually makes sense to be the party out of power, especially with all the fear mongering that's going on for 8 years now, I mean they raised a billion dollars in 3 months imagine how much they can raise in the next 4 years.",

How the fuck is anyone that's not (Party) No Matter Who suppose to vote for that? The same happened to Hillary here in 2016.\n\nBasically, it boils down to public perception: She was perceived as not having a plan, so she lost here. HARD.",
            "No, the Fatal Flaw was that Trump had Dirt on Nancy Pelosi and most of the old timers he was going to release if the Insurrection Trial continued to play out. This is WHY we need term limits. America is pretty blase towards corruption, but only to a point. After about 12 years (2 senate terms or 3 terms in the House), about 90-95% of modern politicians hit a level of perceived corruption even Americans find abhorrent. Perceived as in, I could make a claim and enough Americans will believe it. Look at Alex Jones' Adrenochrome claims. Believable because we've got enough old people who've been in congress 30, 40, even 50 years that people believe they'd do ANYTHING to continue to hold onto power. Which, in some cases on both sides of the aisle, is true. FFS, Nesle, our largest bottled water maker, has paid both political parties to rule that Clean Drinking WATER was not a human right.\n\nThat said...\n\nThe biggest flaws are something that nobody's willing to look at: Overconfidence. The Democratic Party believes it's own hype. In my state, they actually believed that Kamala could win by playing the \"I've got a vagina and melanin\" card. Like the Kamala Ads here came just short of her appearing on screen and literally saying this. Their campaign offices couldn't answer a single question about her political stances, and were pompous assholes with a superiority complex. They act like the tactics that worked when America was financially fine, when most people could worry about things besides \"How am I going to feed/clothe/shelter myself/my family\" would still work. When the people can't do these things, the majority don't care about anything other than themselves.",

I make it a habit to follow the news on both sides of the spectrum. It's about the only way you can come to some kind of reasonable conclusion about what the facts might actually be. \n\nOne of the funniest parts about this election to me is there's nothing that can be cried about as far as how the process went down. You can't complain that he barely won the electoral college, or that he didn't win the popular vote. You also can't continue to keep insulting the electorate and believe it is going to help you politically. When the leaders of the party come out and start insulting their core constituency and some sort of weird maybe we can shame them into voting the way we want them to vote it's always going to backfire \n\nI don't know how to tell you this but what you assume to be an insult toward me something that just makes me laugh, it's the realization that you're unable to examine what's right in front of you in any way other than how it confirms the beliefs you've been propagandized into accepting \n\nFor the record, I have never voted for the president elect, I have always viewed him as somewhat of a joke. That said there was a much funnier joke on the other side this time.",
            "No they did not. Not where it counted. Not in their Campaign offices. And not in their commercials. Do you think the average American watches debates? No. They watch Reality TV, pro wrestling (and think it's real), and the like. Yet, because my State's 90% Blue, their campaign staff in the state can't be bothered to do shit.",
            "So then he misled millions by implying?  Because that's what people were clearly discerning from what he said. \n\nI am glad that Trump voters got over their complaints about Biden's age though.... So there's that",
            "No it isn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t pay any attention to her campaign.\n\nNone of what you put in quotes there has any relation to any of her campaign messaging.",

            "A-FUCKING-GAIN What Campaign In My State? My State's 90% Blue. And together, about 90% of them working together can cobble together enough IQ points between the fucking lot to reach AVERAGE. Yes, She talked about shit on MSNBC, which nobody here watches because, again, 90% are mouth breathers, or Debates (see MSNBC notation). No, if the Democrats want their message to reach the people here, the campaign office needs to know what the fuck is going on, and they need shows like the View to talk about her plans instead of just ragging on Orange Man Bad like he's their deadbeat baby daddy. Trump's always taken his message to the people through low-brow means which works because most Americans are fucking stupider than you fucking give them fucking credit for and low brow entertainment to them is the equivalent to Opera or the Ballet to the cultured.\n\nSo pull your head out of your ass. Because the stupid far outnumber the smart in this country, and you guys practically alienate them by ignoring them and sticking to your base in Academia. Where was Kamala's \"Michelle Obama on Ellen\" moment? Americans have not fucking changed since Baby Bush took office. The only thing smart about us are our mouths and phones. FFS, At least Obama knew to fucking pander to the masses.",

Also and I suppose given your limited intellect you haven't noticed this but I've never once referred to anyone by name. I do not speak that name. If somewhere the word truth got capitalized I had nothing to do with it and I am certainly not a part of that delusional group of people. \n\nBelieve what you want to believe, I'm telling you you're wrong. I don't know anyone that is pro the president elect that is not vocally pro. Certainly on social media where you can be anonymous and say even crazier things than you might in real life, though given my experience with the delusional I know that this is not true. And of course that applies to both sides. \n\nYou have been propaganda eyes ( right there is a speech to text thing, rather than propagandized, it said propaganda eyes, what you got to admit is pretty funny) to the point where you are only able to see people through one of two filters. If you don't want to open your eyes and try to understand things on your own there's nothing I can do to help you. However there are so many excellent sources online from both sides that will give you enough good relevant information that you can make up your own mind about things within without having to goose step to your parties marching orders. \n\nJust think of all the people that went around spending the better part of the week scolding people over the pronunciation of the vice president's name. And telling the American public that if they did not pronounce it the proper way they were either misogynist or racist or worse. Then you can go look for video of these same people pronouncing her name half a dozen different ways. How ridiculous is that? Is that really how you're going to gain the upper hand in the political Battle of what was said to be a lifetime, and now even the president of the United States is brushing off with well we'll get them next time. \n\nYou're actually unable to engage in any kind of discussion of the issues because all you can do is call people names. Basically you don't really know anything other than what you've been propagandized with and apparently you're unable to even repeat that short of just saying you're a supporter you're a supporter and it doesn't matter that you say you're not because I know that you are, please...\n\n\nEDIT: okay, I found the capitalization that you were so worried about, I'm going to give it to you on that one, that it would seem to be a hidden message to the faithful. Once again you can believe what you want to or not but I have not so much as downloaded the app. Anything I have ever seen from it has been posted in a news article. I'm also not on its rival app, it just bores me.",

            "Nothing I have said is about an app. You persist in Trumpiness in your latest, with the easily disprovable false assertions.",
            "The only thing you've done is continually accuse me of being for the president elect. You've actually offered no facts or even an opinion other than what you think. \n\nI'm going to guess you don't read a word that I've said or follow anything other than mainstream news. Go away child"

The only way for a Democrat to win in this environment would be to run against the Biden administration as an outsider Democrat. Kamala couldn't have done that. Democrats voted for competent leadership. Republicans voted for the man who thinks that he can fix inflation with tariffs (and they apparently didn't mind the felonies/ rapes/lies/ sedition).",

She didn't lose because she didn't go on Joe Rogan's idiotic podcast.\n\nIt was always going to be close because there are just that many American voters who really dig Trump's racism and misogyny. Maybe not enough of them to win without an assist, though. In 2016 that assist was James Comey and Vladimir Putin. There was no significant assist in 2020, so he lost. In 2024, the assist was post-pandemic inflation which voters wrongly, but predictably, blamed on the incumbent administration.\n\nShe lost because the bigotry had a side of economics with it.

We should have filled the streets, not paid taxes, stopped working etc. when Trump wasn\u2019t impeached. We missed the boat because there was nobody leading us and we were complacent.",
            "Sadly, all those warning from us over in Europle were ignored. For an old guy like me it has been obvious that things would end up like this. We have seen this movie before in European countries and all over the world. But Americans thought it could never happen to them. - So now democracy in the US is gone and won't come back again. It will become like a \"Russian democracy\" or something similar where fear will be the real ruler. Congress will vote as Emperor Trump 1st will want all the time. The judicial system has proven to be totally useless. We will now see \"Judge Cannon\" type judges everywhere. Americans can thank Moscow Mitch for that. - And we can say goodby to all efforts towards mitigating climate change."

I've been saying that for 40 or 50 years the Republican party has just been one big backlash against the progress made by women and blacks in the 60s and 70s. \"Yeah, right. Because half the country is sexist and racist.\" Well, what do you say now? It's all there, right in your face.

Even NPR does more and better.  Add to that the fact that these papers use paywalls to ensure their good reporting doesn't get shared that much, and isn't accessible to most people.  And the New York Times in particular has been low quality on average for a couple of decades now, extremely gullible and deferring to authority and missing reality in HUGE ways - like completely falling for the obvious bunk Bush and Cheney were promoting about Iraq's supposed nuclear and biological weapons and reporting on that stuff as if it was real when their sources showed otherwise.  They've continued like that to the present, where even in the past few months their editors seem to have been removing reporters' references to Trump's mental decline from articles, and rewriting headlines to sanewash his gibberish.\n\nAt least now the wave of cancellations of Washington Post subscriptions is, itself, making news, and that could do some good.\n\nTake your money away from these papers and send it to organizations that are really committed to investigative reporting and don't put it behind paywalls where it can't compete with the low-effort right wing propaganda outlets.",

            "Hey all, thanks for reading. James Carville, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns, explains in a guest essay why Kamala Harris will be president:\n\n\"The biggest reason Mr. Trump will lose is that the whole Republican Party has been on a losing streak since Mr. Trump took it over,\" writes James. \"Since joining the race, the vice president has raised an\u00a0eye-boggling $1 billion, and last quarter one of her fund-raising committees reeled\u00a0in $633\u00a0million \u2014 dwarfing what Mr. Trump raised with two committees combined. All this cash not only effectively offsets the flow of money funneling in for Mr. Trump from some\u00a0tech billionaires, but it has also given Ms. Harris the resources she needs to persuade swing voters with ads and to organize on the ground.\"\n\nRead the rest of the essay\u00a0[here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/opinion/kamala-harris-win-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.HD4e.giigO_RmjlyN&smid=re-nytopinion), without a subscription to The New York Times."

Chump will definitely start sending out tweets and putting it in his rally speeches. \n\nWhen Don the Con became president, it almost instantly started to rise Bush's standing as a president. Now he's the imp who passes candy to Michelle Obama at memorial services and shares his luxury box with Ellen Degeneres. \n\nOne other possible reason might simply be he is trying to time it for maximum impact. Republicans, particularly older ones, are well known for voting in person. So maybe Bush will be \"the\" October surprise, endorsing Harris a week or two before the election.",

Crucial to our nation\u2019s future, she\u2019s proving to be an effective protector against the protection racket itself.\"\n\nRead the rest of the essay\u00a0[here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/opinion/kamala-harris-donald-trump-security.html?unlocked_article_code=1.QU4.7gRo.eHGCLxL5LZuE&smid=re-nytopinion), without a subscription to The New York Times.",

If she can make all of the awful things that Donald Trump personifies omnipresent in their minds then they will not be considering \u201c Let\u2019s give this guy a chance. What could go wrong?\u201d.\n\nAll she really has to do is make the men\u2019s skin crawl at the idea of leaving their daughters and sisters alone with Donald Trump.

            "The republican party is nothing but the party of hypocrisy, crying, hate, and projection.  For all their preaching, screaming, and trying to pass bullshit laws; why is it that it's always the republicans that try to change the state rules at the last minute or get caught trying to illegally vote and cheat at elections???",
            "the GOP is trying to trigger a Contingent Election. if no clear winner can be determined it is then thrown to the House to decide....guess who controls the House.\n\n they are doing whatever they can to disrupt the Election JUST so they can do an end run around the fact they CAN NOT win the popular Vote....and they know it.\n\nwhy do you think trump has stopped campaigning?  because they have given up on getting the most votes and are planning on cheating.",
            "Senator Lindsey Graham, \u201cIf Republicans don\u2019t challenge and change the US election system, there will never be another Republican president elected again.\u201d  \n\nThe republican party is dying - this is another last ditch effort to grab and keep power by voter suppression and cheating, if necessary. The election system 'changes' Graham speak of are not to make it easier for citizens to vote but to disenfranchise them.",
            "It certainly raises red flags, but according to the article, this was only for overseas absentee voting, not the local absentee voting or general voting, & when contacted about the problem it was immediately shut down & apologized for as a mistake, & a statement that all votes would be counted was given, even contacting the Harris campaign to work things out.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, this time it **is** just a really bad mistake blown out of proportion instead of a malicious act intended to circumvent the voice of of the people, like all those weirdos openly saying that they won\u2019t certify local election results",
            "oh for bloody sake, it is a website controlled by the goverment, of course something is going to go wrong, this time people are throwing a hissyfit because it involved Harris, but I bet if it involved trump nobody would care. \n\nRegardless mistakes do seriously happen, unless there is more proof to show this was intentional other than saying the guy in charge is a republican then knock it off.",

            "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re totally wrong, but I think the narrative of the \u201cRepublican Party is dying\u201d runs the hazard of breeding complacency. I know that was not your intention. \n\nIt\u2019s clear the whole MAGA movement has arisen from this desperation on behalf of the GOP to maintain relevancy, and it\u2019s worked. \n\nThe numbers may be diminishing, but if the voting minority is rabid enough, they will blow right through any barricades erected to protect democratic institutions.\n\nI know that is more or less what you\u2019re saying, but I would push back on the idea that it\u2019s a \u201clast ditch effort\u201d. They may be desperate, but they aren\u2019t going to stop if this effort fails. There are many more ditches for them to dig, this won\u2019t be the last one, and the other ditches are going to be deeper and wider. (Forgive my use of a metaphor I might be using incorrectly).\n\nAnyway the point is, we have to counter the rabid few with our majority, our reason, and importantly, our energy, all the way down the ballot, in every district we can. It\u2019s a tough combination.",
            ">It certainly raises red flags, but according to the article, this was only for overseas absentee voting, not the local absentee voting or general voting\n\nHow would someone make such a ridiculously stupid mistake honestly though?  I'm not seeing a picture of the incorrect ballot, but the way the article is written it's not like they put the wrong candidate, they just *didn't list a candidate at all for one of the two main parties*.  And even if they somehow screwed that up without malice (which I don't believe for a nanosecond), the fact that it's only wrong on SOME ballots shows that ballots for the same offices in the same election are different when there's no reason for them to be, which implies some fuckery.  And the guy in charge has already been caught screwing around with petitions to remove names he doesn't like, so clearly there's a pattern of dishonesty.",
            "Imagine if the mistake had been leaving Trump off one single ballot? Montana election offices would be *on fire* right now.",
            "> Maybe, just maybe, this time it is just a really bad mistake blown out of proportion\n\nNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.",
            "First, let me be clear that I am definitely not saying it 100% wasn\u2019t anything malicious - I don\u2019t have the info for that, & maybe it was - I actually wasn\u2019t aware that the person in charge had been removing names previously, which definitely lends weight that this was intentional\n\nBut if you\u2019ve ever been involved with putting out digital tech, yes, stupid mistakes like this happen all the time - critical, obvious things not showing as they should can happen from a single wrong character in a line of code, & finding that 1 issue can be incredibly frustrating when you expected the code to work, & everything else is working fine, so you obviously didn\u2019t mess everything up \n\nThere\u2019s so much actual malice from the extreme right, it can be tempting to sometimes attribute to evil what should instead be attributed to stupidity or genuine accident, & so easy to want to get ahead to the obvious conclusions before evidence has actually told us anything",
            "Oh yeah, they\u2019d definitely be shouting it from every rightwing media outlet & spinning it into a vast conspiracy against tronald dump."

            "I get Steele\u2019s thoughts. I\u2019m in Florida. Yes Jacksonville did get a democrat mayor! Love you Deagan! But for the rest of the state? Ima say good luck! They have literally paid off all of the ethnic radio stations to pump the maga narrative. The people who actually know what socialism and communism means! I\u2019m not talking about some side station out of a garage. But the three main ones. They literally just had a show about it on NPR. MAGA has done their homework and it\u2019s working. I mean they have immigrant\u2019s hating on each other? If any state would benefit from the POLICIES OF THE DEMOCRATS, Florida would be first seat! Unfortunately, they don\u2019t. And it\u2019s sad. I live at the beach and it floors me that so many people here are against anything and everything that will protect us. Just to own the libs. It\u2019s just like are you against Obamacare? Damn right! Do you want universal healthcare? Of course! This is the problem!",

The panhandle is ruby-red, and the Cuban population have been brainwashed to think that all the Democrats are ferocious Marxists. \n\nI would unfortunately bet against Florida ever being a swing-state.  It's too much to hope for.",

It makes liberals feel that they are no longer isolated -- and somehow \"mainstream.\"  Sad.  Cheney says America may need a new party. But who would invite her -- she's a pariah and Dems will never trust her, either?  The latest polls out of the Sunbelt swing states -- released today -- are devastating news for Harris -- truly.",

At the end of a long work or school day, there are plenty of people who will go \"Why bother, the Dems never win here. Waste of time and I don't want to stand in that fucking line for nothing.\"",
            "Texas, maybe. I would be surprised, but not shocked. Big black population, big Hispanic and lots of younger people who while they don't vote in big numbers they do vote Democratic which is what happened in the mid-terms. And she has them fired up unlike Biden in 2020. \n\nBut Alabama and Utah means you are joking.",

You said that you care about whatever, the republicans call it a hoax? You see that our backyard(the beach) is not getting better? You think the democrats care? Actually yes! Yes they do!",

            "Wow. That sounds terrible.",
            "I'm staying optimistic and disagreeing. Everyone wants to relate this election to 2016 with Clinton, but I see a lot more excitement and enthusiasm toward Harris. The sentiment for a lot in 2016 seemed to be that Hillary was a shoe-in so it was safe to just stay home and expect her to win. After four years of Trump as president - not to mention just a decade of having to hear about him nonstop in general - Dems seem energized to vote in as great of numbers as possible and give Trump the most resounding political deathblow possible. I hope the enthusiasm I see online and in the real world carries over to the polls, but I genuinely feel that a lot of Dems have learned a valuable lesson on voting over these past 10 years. Biden had immense turn-out, and that was a candidate that a lot of people were just getting their teeth and voting against Trump for, but people seem actually excited about Harris, rather than just throwing a vote against Trump no matter who."

            "They were saying the same thing with Hillary. Don\u2019t put the cart in front of the horse. The worst thing these writers can do is make it seem like voters don\u2019t even need to bother showing up because it\u2019s in the bag.",
            "All headlines like this will do is talk people out of bothering to vote. \n\n**VOTE!!!**",
            "Every time I see this type of message,  my statement is the same, \"doesn't matter,  please vote!\"   Trump won't care how many votes that Harris gets,  but many other Republicans will.   We are even seeing Marjorie Taylor Green, make more sense than usual while appealing to her voting public.",
            "That would go a long way towards repairing the damage Trump caused.\n\nIt would be much more difficult for SCOTUS to overturn the election.\n\nDemocratic wins in the house and the senate could save America for a decade.",
            "I\u2019m more worried about the Senate at this point.  There\u2019s just too many Republicans that don\u2019t want trump at this point.",
            "Someone needs to tell this to the people answering the polls. \n\nSo far we're in a \"Leans Harris if polls are correct\" and \"Trump wins if they're incorrect in the normal way\".",
            "Literally the only thing that could help restore faith in the US.  We aren\u2019t going against a reasonable person like Romney or McCain. We are going against someone who is treason, crime, narcissism, dementia, and hate incarnate.",
            "The difference this time if trump tries to incite another insurrection when he loses (and he WILL lose), is that Biden is in office and will absolutely deploy the military. Remember that last time trump replaced pentagon officials at the very end of his term, for this reason- he needed people in place who would go along with his plan... and it almost worked. This time he has no control from the inside, so any insurrectionist traitor chuds will be shut down immediately by the troops that will no doubt be on call and ready if he tries anything. We are going to *finally* flush this orange turd for good this time. (Sometimes particularly rancid dumps like this one need a courtesy flush. It's coming.)",

            "I'm hoping for a Kamala landslide along with the rest of this sub, but I am reminded of an old scam in the stock market industry.\n\nHow it works is that some wall street pro picks a stock and mails out flyers predicting how it will perform in the future. Half of the flyers predict the stock is going to go up the other half predict it is going to go down. If it goes up or down half of the people who received these flyers will think the guy must be some sort of stock guru who can predict the future so they subscribe to his newsletter.\n\nObiously, these election predictions can't work the same scam because they can't both predict a candidate will win and lose at the same time. But there's always another election and whoever was right about the last one gets hired by someone for the next election.\n\nRemember to vote like your life depends on it and do something else too, like donate money or phone bank.",

            "His premise is that PredictIt tracks the popular vote. That's dumb--to the point that I assume this is deliberate misinformation to depress turnout or something. Predictit tracks \"investors''\" belief about the likelihood of a candidate winning the election. The electoral college is priced in.\n\nTo give you an idea of how vacuous that assumption is, Predictit was 95-5 in the days before the election in 2016. Would his \"model\" have predicted Clinton getting 95% of the popular vote if it had existed in 2016? Not even the most wildly optimistic, echo chambered Democrat would have believed that.",

            "I would love there to be, because I think that\u2019s the only way to end the MAGA cult (and even that might not work, as they won\u2019t believe the result and are already threatening violence). They need to show that way only leads to huge defeats, for the old school Republicans to really work to rid themselves of Trump, MYG, LB, Gaets etc. But I can\u2019t see it.

They need two of these especially when you hear Jon Testor and Sherod Brown are in close races. Now possibly a couple of the nominees want to keep their distance from Harris ie. Biden",

With any luck, they are being weighed too heavily this time.\n\nBut this time, we have our own groups. To a lesser extent, we have Republicans who are going to not only not vote for Chump, but will actually vote for Harris. Keep those GOP primary voters who voted for Nikki Haley long after she dropped out and it was just Trump. Just a fraction of them alone in key swing states could decide it. \n\nYet the biggest secret weapon not represented in polls will be voters 18-25. They went 60% for the Dems in the mid-terms in the same key swing states we need this year and they are notoriously hard to poll. If Harris takes Georgia, Florida and, in the upset of the Century, Texas it will be largely due to the over-performing depsite still low levels of voting.",

So Republicans were scrambling to get info on him.\n\nIt was clear that Obama was a contender to win by Jan 25th when he took South Carolina despite the Clintons' past victories there and Hilary spending a lot time & resources. Even when she won it was also clear that some of his victories were much larger, taking more delegates. They also believed the BS that still lingers to this day that the DNC was in the tank for the Clintons so it was done deal (an inconvenient truth that Bernie Bros also dismissed, forgetting that Obama had already disproved that BS). \n\nAnd they didn't have to scramble, they threw a lot of shit at him. It's just that then as now the Dems had a positive message to sell while the GOP tried for fear & hate with no alternative message of hope. \n\nPlus, Republicans own inherent racism blinded them, thinking that a lot of moderate, \"Reagan Democrats\" would also not vote for him.",

            "The smart money says the 2024 US presidential election hinges on the financial concerns of swing voters in battleground states.\n\nAnd sooner or later, when\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0takes a temporary break from his\u00a0ridiculous grievances, he may succeed in focusing the election debate in this direction.\n\nSo how would Harris answer the lethal question that Ronald Reagan posed to viewers during the final presidential debate with President Jimmy Carter in 1980: \u201cAre you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d Back then, the electorate answered \u201dno\u201d and put Reagan in power.\n\nIt\u2019s not really a fair question \u2013 least of all in 2024 after the American economy, like all other major economies, has spent the previous three years recovering from the inflation shock caused by the\u00a0Ukraine war\u00a0and the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe latter event, exacerbated by Trump\u2019s ineptitude, saw the Biden administration hand out billions in pandemic relief. This largesse was not sustainable for long. It\u2019s been sorely missed by working- and middle-class families.\n\nThe myth of Trump\u2019s financial acumen still persists in the minds of many Americans, despite his list of failed businesses and a record in government of tax cuts for the super-rich that caused the\u00a0national debt\u00a0to spiral by $7.8trn (\u00a35.9tn).\n\nEconomic growth under Trump was nothing special. If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation\u00a0averaged 2.67 per cent\u00a0under Trump, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. So far, under\u00a0[Joe Biden](https://inews.co.uk/topic/joe-biden?ico=in-line_link), annual growth is averaging 3.4 per cent.\n\nBut people have short memories. And here are some of the numbers giving\u00a0[Kamala Harris](https://inews.co.uk/topic/kamala-harris?ico=in-line_link)\u00a0nightmares:\n\n* \\* 9 \u2013 the percentage at which inflation peaked in 2023, and the highest in four decades\n* \\* 34 \u2013 the percentage of Americans who say they live\u00a0paycheck to paycheck.\n* \\* 69 \u2013 the preliminary consumer confidence reading for September in the\u00a0University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index\u00a0(CSI). Successful presidential candidates typically score 90 per cent or more.\n\nNews this month suggests Harris is\u00a0closing\u00a0the gap\u00a0on Trump regarding the public\u2019s confidence in her economic competence, and that she is managing to distance herself from the blame attached to Biden\u2019s handling of the country\u2019s finances.\n\nBut even in this survey more respondents thought they would be better off financially if Trump were re-elected, with 40 per cent saying they would either be somewhat or much better off under his presidency compared with 35 per cent who thought they would be better off under Harris.\n\nThe fact is many Americans were still no better off than they were in the last pre-pandemic year, 2019, a fact highlighted last week by the\u00a0United States Census Bureau.\n\nInflation-adjusted household income in 2023 stands at $80,610 (\u00a361,236) \u2013 a little lower than its 2019 level of\u00a0$81,210 (\u00a361,692). The gap is worse though, if you look at real income after taxes (and tax credits), which better reflects what households were actually able to spend. Incomes actually increased during Covid shutdowns, thanks to government handouts. But when these ended, real income after taxes dropped significantly.",
            "\u201cThis is one of the biggest reasons that Democrats have struggled to sell Americans on the merits of President Joe Biden\u2019s economic stewardship,\u201d a\u00a0*Washington Post*\u00a0editorial noted last week. \u201cMs Harris should be honest about that decline, while also explaining why the 2020 and 2021 figures weren\u2019t sustainable, and why there\u00a0are still lots of reasons to think the economy is strong and capable of getting stronger.\u201d\n\nMajor financial news this week might give Harris the opportunity to tackle the subject head on \u2013 and set the agenda. The Federal Reserve is expected to finally\u00a0announce\u00a0a cut in interest rates today, with Wall Street betting on a significant half-point cut.\n\nThis is Harris\u2019s chance to tell voters that the economy\u00a0has turned a corner. An interest rate cut will lower mortgage costs for homeowners. The rate cut is made possible by a slowing economy, but on the plus side, inflation has now fallen to 2.5 per cent.\n\nSo far, her economic promises have centred on tax policy. She has talked about\u00a0expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 (\u00a34,558) bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 (\u00a318,991) first-time homebuyer tax credit and end to taxes on waiters\u2019 tips. In contrast to Trump, Harris has pledged to raise corporate tax from 21 per cent to 28 per cent. Her opponent wants to lower it to 15 per cent.\n\nHarris doesn\u2019t have any great economic ideas and her grasp of the subject has left most pundits unimpressed. And some experts are puzzled\u00a0over Trump\u2019s failure to exploit her vulnerabilities on the economy.\n\n\u201cTrump hasn\u2019t kept a relentless focus on the issue by tying Harris to big government programmes that overheated the US economy,\u201d says Thomas Gift, director of the UCL Centre on US Politics. \u201cNor has he made a convincing case that some of Harris\u2019s new policy proposals \u2013 from anti-price gouging laws to subsidies for first-time homeowners \u2013 would only make the economic situation for many Americans worse.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a degree of irony that Biden, from whom Harris would like to create some distance due to the cost of living\u00a0crisis, has put the US economy on firm footing for the years ahead. The investment that Biden\u00a0piled into infrastructure and clean energy\u00a0already is reaping dividends for the US economy, which has emerged from the Covid-Ukraine double whammy better than any other Western country.\n\nAs the\u00a0*FT*\u2019s Edward Luce notes, Harris \u201cis handicapped by her inability to distance herself too much from\u00a0Bidenomics, which remains unpopular even though its track record is pretty good\u201d.\n\nHarris has talked about an \u201copportunity economy\u201d. But no one really knows what this means, given her hodge-podge of proposals from child tax credits\u00a0and Soviet-sounding price controls to watered-down capital gains tax hikes on the wealthy.",
            "Harris might benefit from a blunt attack on the nonsensical aspects of her opponent\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s vow to slap\u00a0enormous tariffs\u00a0(up to 60 per cent) on imports from China would push up inflation and risk the jobs of the millions of US workers who supply overseas manufacturers with goods and services.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem to realise that US consumers pay the tariffs, not the foreign exporters.\n\nThe man who still touted the\u00a0\u201cArt of the Deal\u201d seems even less versed in economics than his Democratic opponent.\n\nHarris\u2019s best bet would probably be telling the electorate what they want to hear, without insulting their intelligence. Inflation IS down, interest rates are falling, things are getting better after some tough years. And the\u00a0return of Trump\u00a0risks taking America back to chaos and joblessness. If she says it long enough and loud enough, it might get through.\n\n\u201cI think she\u00a0will continue with the message that the economy is improving but the middle class still needs help paying for housing, groceries and medical care,\u201d says Todd Belt, a professor of political science at George Washington University. \u201cShe then will pivot to talking about her plans. It\u2019s risky to look like she\u2019s resting on the laurels of an improving economy without empathising with people dealing with high prices.\u201d\n\nBut that won\u2019t happen if she shies away from\u00a0the subject and journalists\u2019 questions. With just seven weeks to go, it might be now or never for Harris to make her case this week on the economy\n\nRead more on i: [https://inews.co.uk/news/world/numbers-kamala-harris-nightmares-how-turn-around-3281472](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/numbers-kamala-harris-nightmares-how-turn-around-3281472)"

Michael Indriolo/The Portager\nResidents express fear after sheriff says \u2018write down all the addresses\u2019 of Harris supporters\nBen Wolford\u00b7September 16, 2024\u00b74 min read\nPortage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski seemed to encourage his friends and supporters to write down the addresses of people with Democratic yard signs, sparking accusations of voter intimidation.\n\nIn identical posts to his personal and public Facebook accounts on Sept. 13, Zuchowski wrote what he claims to tell people who ask him what will happen if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election. Using dehumanizing language, he says he tells them to record the addresses of people with Harris yard signs in order to house immigrants with them.\n\n\u201cWhen people ask me\u2026What\u2019s gonna happen if the Flip \u2013 Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins?? I say\u2026write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards! Sooo\u2026when the Illegal human \u201cLocust\u201d (which she supports!) Need places to live\u2026We\u2019ll already have the addresses of the their New families\u2026who supported their arrival!\u201d the posts stated, along with accompanying pictures of a television tuned to Fox News. \n\n\nIn the comments under the post on his personal Facebook page, one supporter replied with the name and street of someone with a Harris sign. \u201cI\u2019ll add that name to the list,\u201d another replied. Someone else commented, \u201cMaking a list and checking it twice.\u201d\n\nAs of Sept. 15, that post had hundreds of reactions and over 100 shares.\n\nZuchowski faces a Democratic challenger to his re-election bid in November. He did not reply to questions emailed to him on Sept. 14.\n\nThe reaction from residents and Portage County officials was intense over the weekend, with people saying they have filed complaints to state and federal agencies, members of Congress and the ACLU. Others are reconsidering putting political signs in their yards, they said. \n\nThe most high-profile denunciation came on Sept. 15, when Portage County Commissioner Tony Badalamenti criticized the sheriff\u2019s post and announced his resignation from the county\u2019s Republican Central Committee. \n\n\u201cThis is not the leadership I want to be part of,\u201d he said in a video posted to Facebook.\n\nBadalamenti had previously clashed with Zuchowski over the sheriff\u2019s requests for larger and larger budget allocations. Badalamenti had previously supported additional funding but later said the county could no longer afford to meet Zuchowski\u2019s requests. \n\nThis refusal helped precipitate a rift in the Portage County Republican Party that led Zuchowski to endorse primary challengers for Badalamenti\u2019s and Commissioner Sabrina Christian-Bennett\u2019s commission seats. Badalamenti lost his primary race to the Zuchowski-backed candidate.\n\nBadalamenti could not be reached for comment, but in the video he seemed to suggest the sheriff\u2019s Facebook post was the last straw.\n\n\u201c[Zuchowski] posted that we should all copy down the addresses of the people that display political signs which are different from our beliefs,\u201d Badalamenti said. \u201cIt scares people. It\u2019s called bullying, from the highest law enforcement official in Portage County.\u201d\n\nPortage County residents who contacted The Portager said they were surprised and fearful. \n\n\u201cI have a sign in my yard. Our sheriff is asking MAGA to write down our addresses. This is not normal and it is scary,\u201d one person said.\n\nAnother expressed concern for her parents: \u201cMy parents are elderly and have been very politically active Democrats. I am afraid for them now. I don\u2019t want to scare them or suggest they take down their signs, but I am sick to my stomach with worry.\u201d\n\nOthers drew parallels between Zuchowski\u2019s reference to people as \u201clocusts\u201d and racist rhetoric that took place during genocides in Germany and Rwanda.\n\n\u201cThe Portage County NAACP was very disappointed to see the divisive post from our elected sheriff,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that law enforcement and elected officials both have a duty to ensure public safety for all citizens. Encouraging people to keep addresses, presumably so they can later be targeted, is counter to bringing all of us together to better our community. We encourage all citizens to vote their values in November.\u201d\n\nPortage County Democratic Party Chair Denise Smith also encouraged voters to respond to the sheriff\u2019s comments at the polls.\n\n\u201cAny elected official is free to put whatever they want on their personal Facebook page,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that someone believes is intimidation, the way to counter that is to vote against that in November, and the 109,000 registered voters should fire any elected official that tries to intimidate them.\u201d\n\nSmith said the Portage County Democrats have distributed around 750 Harris yard signs and that residents had been calling her on Saturday. Several told her they were reporting the sheriff\u2019s comments to the attorney general, she said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the post crosses any legal lines. Portage County Prosecutor Vic Vigluicci could not be reached for comment. Smith, a lawyer, declined to offer a legal analysis but said, \u201cI would be intimidated if he said it to me.\u201d\n\nJon Barber, the Democratic candidate for sheriff, said the episode illustrates the difference between the two men. He said he found the racist language \u201cappalling\u201d and that, in any case, undocumented migration is not a major issue in Portage County.\n\n\u201cI think we can agree that people who are fleeing their home countries and are willing to come across a treacherous plain and unbearable conditions are doing it to seek a better life for their children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sheriff and the former president think they\u2019re all criminals. And I have a hard time seeing that.\u201d\n\nHe said he has talked to residents over the weekend who were concerned about putting out signs.\n\n\u201cHe ordered his supporters to write down addresses and make a list so that they can pass those on to potential criminals,\u201d Barber said. \u201cI certainly feel that this is voter intimidation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI encourage everybody to ensure you\u2019re registered to vote and that your registration is good,\u201d Barber said.\n\nWe will update this article with any comments from Zuchowski or the sheriff\u2019s office.",

Part of what has happened here is somewhat unique to Iowa. \n\nBecause the state has been traditionally first in the nation, Iowa used to have a more robust localized media organization. It meant that candidates (Democrat or Republican) could organize and run strong grass roots campaigns. The electorate was much less influenced by the Hannity, Limbaugh ecosystem than their other midwestern counterparts. However over the course of the last 10-15 years local newspapers had dwindled and national right wing media has taken hold. The rural margins that used to look more like 55/45 Republican are now more like 75/25 Republican. \n\nAt least that\u2019s my understanding.

        "Text": "**Title: The Trumpian Odyssey: A Satirical Journey into the Land of the Golden Hair**\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land not so far away, a reality TV star with a penchant for gold-plated everything stumbled upon a magical portal known as the 2016 election. With the flick of his perfectly coiffed hair, he unleashed a whirlwind of tweets, promises, and slogans that would make even the most seasoned politicians do a double-take.\n\nIn this fantastical realm, where logic took a backseat and facts were mere suggestions, our hero, let\u2019s call him \u201cThe Donald,\u201d embarked on a quest to make \u201cAmerica Great Again\u201d\u2014a slogan that was as elusive as the mythical unicorn. With a trusty sidekick, the Twitter Bird, he soared through the skies of social media, spreading tales of building walls and banning tacos (or was it Muslims?).\n\nAs The Donald ascended to the throne, the world looked on in a mix of disbelief and hilarity. His press conferences became the stuff of legends\u2014where facts were optional, and the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d was thrown around like confetti at a parade. Who knew that the art of the deal also included dodging accountability and redefining what \u201ctruth\u201d really meant?\n\nAnd then came the international stage! With all the grace of a toddler on roller skates, he waltzed into meetings with world leaders, proclaiming himself the \u201cgreatest negotiator\u201d while threatening to unleash tariffs like they were confetti cannons at a birthday party. Alliances that took decades to forge were shaken like a snow globe, all while he bragged about his \u201cbigly\u201d achievements.\n\nBut the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was his climate policy\u2014or lack thereof. In a world already grappling with rising temperatures, The Donald decided that the best course of action was to deny the existence of climate change, declaring it a hoax invented by the Chinese. Because who needs a sustainable future when you can have a booming fossil fuel industry, right?\n\nAs the years rolled on, The Donald\u2019s antics transformed the political landscape into a circus\u2014complete with a cast of characters that would make even the most imaginative playwright weep with joy. From \u201calternative facts\u201d to \u201ccovfefe,\u201d the lexicon of absurdity expanded, leaving the world both bewildered and entertained.\n\nIn the end, as his presidency came to a close, one had to wonder: was this a cautionary tale or a comedy of errors? Perhaps it was both\u2014a reminder that in the theater of politics, sometimes the lines between satire and reality blur, leaving us all to ponder the true meaning of leadership in the age of The Donald.\n\nSo here\u2019s to the rise of Donald Trump: a wild ride filled with laughter, disbelief, and the occasional facepalm. May we learn from this chapter in history, ensuring that the next act is one where reason, empathy, and perhaps a little less gold take center stage.",

        "Text": "Muslims in Michigan began seeing pro-Israel ads this fall praising Vice President Kamala Harris for marrying a Jewish man and backing the Jewish state. Jews in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, saw ads from the same group with the opposite message: Harris wanted to stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel.Another group promoted \u201cKamala\u2019s bold progressive agenda\u201d to conservative-leaning Donald Trump voters, while a third filled the phones of young liberals with videos about how Harris had abandoned the progressive dream. Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches.What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the group\u2019s efforts obtained by The Washington Post.The project, funded with anonymous donations, micro-targeted messages across the battleground states, often with ads that appeared to be something they were not \u2014 a tactic the organizers sometimes referred to internally as \u201cfalse positives.\u201dWith digital spots, direct mail, text messages, influencer marketing and mobile billboards, the overall project was a high-tech experiment in misdirection \u2014 an old political tactic that has been sharpened in recent decades with increasingly precise targeting techniques.Ads tested better if Muslims felt they were seeing a message meant for Zionists, \u201cBernie bros\u201d felt they were hearing from the far left, and \u201cZyn bros\u201d felt they were hearing from activists who wanted \u201ca world without gas-powered vehicles,\u201d a ban on fracking and affordable housing for undocumented Americans \u2014 policies Harris did not actually support during her campaign.\u201cThe worst part is Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth,\u201d said one of the ads, which was designed by Trump supporters to look as if it was advocating for leftist priorities like \u201cfree health care\u201d and a \u201cbreak on tuition.\u201dElon Musk speaks at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in New York on Oct. 27. A group of Musk political advisers funded a $45 million misdirection campaign targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)The entire effort grew out of research by Building America\u2019s Future, a conservative political nonprofit that was founded during the first Trump administration by Republican consultants Generra Peck and Phil Cox. With others at P2 Public Affairs, Peck and Cox, former advisers to DeSantis, were top strategists for a separate effort, America PAC, the super PAC funded by Musk to support Trump. Musk donated to Building America\u2019s Future in 2022, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The group\u2019s leaders have declined to comment on their donors.Starting in February, Ryan Tyson, a former pollster for DeSantis, began holding a series of about 25 focus groups with specific communities of targeted voters, with most of the research effort focused on likely Democrats who were uncertain about voting. The goal was to figure out how to help Donald Trump win during a campaign in which Democrats were vastly outspending Republicans on digital advertising\u2026\u2026.",

        "Text": "Amendment 4 to the Constitution of the state of Florida was passed (with 65% in favor) in 2018. This amendment (partially*) restored voting rights to convicted felons who have completed all of the terms of their sentence (including fines, fees etc). \n\nIf that Amendment had failed on the ballot, or if the Courts had struck it down, Donald Trump would not have been able to vote in this election or any other as long as he is a resident of Florida. \n\nAs with any law, it's more complicated than that. Depending on the type of felony, and whether the conviction was in Florida or another state, there are conditions for things like Clemency by the Governor and state cabinet. \n\nWithout digging too deeply into those scenarios, I'm wondering if anyone else finds it absurd that a resident of Florida (or another state with similar laws) could not vote in their own election? I'd like to know if those laws have ever been challenged as unconstitutional at the federal level, but as of today they are law. \n\nA constitutional law to limit or deny convicted criminals the right to VOTE, but no restrictions on running for election, up to and including the highest office in the country. What do we think about that? \n\n* murder and sexual assault convictions are still banned for life. \n\nTL;DR As a resident of Florida, Trump could not have VOTED if Amendment 4 had not been added to the state constitution in 2018, but he still could have been on the ballot?

        "Text": "Bernie Sanders released a statement yesterday following the election results that could not have been more accurate. The Democrat party have completely turned their backs on working families.  As 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, the DNC, Biden, and Kamala have continuously said the economy said was strong and healthy.\n\n  \nInflation & the economy were top issues in this presidential cycle for independent voters, which indicates their displeasure for the current estate of affairs. If inflation was low and the economy were strong, it wouldn't have been an issue. This led to hundreds of thousands of voters to cast their vote for Donald Trump, who has swayed them with his hopes and promises.\n\nThe reality is, Trump will not make this economy stronger in 4 years, it will be WEAKER. Trump's tax cuts will create a bigger deficit in our budget, along with the continuation of foreign aid to Israel. Harris would not have made this economy stronger either. This current economy is not solely the blame of Biden, its been a continuation of wasteful military spending and other reckless spending beginning with George W. Bush, now being passed back to Trump. The US has been lucky to not have been in a complete recession since then, simply the can is being kicked down the road. And the continuation of bank bailouts and corporate leaders in bed with the government will only make us WEAKER.\n\n  \nIf you are are Trump supporter, you need to recognize that Trump cannot fix this economy with his current plan. He wants to cut interest rates,  lower taxes, and maintain government spending, this is QE and inflationary.\n\n  \nIf you are a Harris supporter, you need to recognize that in certain places of our country currently people pay more in taxes than they do Norway, Sweden, Finland etc. Why is it that we pay more in taxes and do not have free education, healthcare, homeless programs like our friends in Europe? Hint: It's the government's mismanagement of funds.\n\n  \nI don't predict the US will have a better economy in the foreseeable future, it will have to create a Great Depression for any change to occur, because their needs to be DRASTIC change.\n\n  \nWhether you are friends of the RNC or DNC, federal government spending and management is a total disaster. If we want to be like our friends in Europe, we need leave the Federal Government with responsibility of the military, and allow State & Local governments more power to assist the people in need of their jurisdiction. \n\n  \nGovernment programs such as Trump's PPP loans, FEMA, student loans are part of the problem. If we simply got rid of our federal government student loan programs, tuition would drastically be less, if our tax money went to state & local governments and people want free education in their state, they should be able to vote and keep their local politicians accountable.\n\nDC cannot possibly be knowledgeable for the needs of people in Hawaii, Alaska, or Florida, however the local governments who are on the ground are. The problem with the US is the Federal government's lousy job in thinking they know what's right for its people, and wasteful spending on things the people did not ask for.\n\n  \nSo if you voted for Trump or Harris, our economy will be much more worse in 4 years than it is now. The stock market sky rocketing because of a Trump win yesterday, tells me people still don't get it.\n\n\n\n ",

        "Title": "The \"Delusions\"",
        "Text": "Once again, as in my first post, I will address the mythical government figures that were actually just fabrications. \n\nFirst of all, Barrack Obama. If you look into the inner depths of the US deep state (a phrase that I might remind the Fascist writers of Project 2025 appropriated to justify wanting to dissolve the department of education) you will find files detailing Czech President V\u00e1clav Klaus assassinating Obama on April 5th 2009. Hours after this, a body double was placed to hold a speech about nuclear weapons, to disguise the act.\n\nThis body double was brought back to the US, and assumed the role of President. Howevee, in late 2013, this body double would die of natural causes (just ask the staff of George Washington University Hospital). Unwilling to inform the public, advanced projection, deepfaking, and CGI technology was used to fabricate the next 3 years of the Obama presidency. To this day, the government occasionally brings out this Obama faker tech to major Democratic Party events such as this year's DNC. It shouldn't be surprising that it was current President Joe Biden who planned all of this, to disguise his secret takeover of power with a council of government officials, such as the secretary of state, treasurer, and speaker of the house (who used her and later his power in planning the house of representatives to unschedule and quell discussion about these facts).\n\nOnto another fabrication, this time being John McCain. It is amazing how far the US will go to conceal their actions. Now, John may be the most important. He was the first we know for sure. His faking set a precedent for the US to do similar actions, such as the previously mentioned Obamaspiracy. Now, John McCain might have actually been a real person. In one of my posts, I incorrectly stated there was no birth certificate, but since then I have done more digging, and God (calling me from a 1995 Nokia in Albania) has guided me. However, there is still a major gap in his life (1981-1987) that is preceded by strange circumstances in his home town just weeks before this gap of knowledge is thought to have started. Strange black vans and questions asked to the local populace. This gap started with John disappearing from the public eye and the death of his father (an assassination of an admiral orchestrated by the US government). Now it is unknown whether the actual John McCain was used as a puppet, being appointed a senator in 1987, or whether he was killed, his identity stolen, and used in the previously mentioned advanced technology, which the government has had since at least 1945, where they faked splitting an atom, an action physically impossible, to fake John's entire existence. Regardless, John McCain as we know him was a fabrication. He was not intended to win in 2008. There was serious ballot stuffing in Obama's favour, even with Obama still being the more popular candidate, to guarantee his already likely victory, since the government had no plans for John McCain to win.\n\nI'd like to quickly address another sidetrack from my first post. It doesn't matter who you vote for, but we can agree that Bill Clinton was a pathological liar. Not only did he target Hillary Clinton in a severe DA case that ended with her tragic death in the 90s, but then went on, hours later, to give his famous \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\" speech with a straight face. It's unnatural. There is no empathy for his actions in those eyes. Still in such recent memory as well for him. Horrific. Considering his radical centrist policies, I would not be suprised if he was also a fabrication, but this has just been hidden too well. Regardless, the government used a convenient figure they could dig up who they also knew everything about, Hillary, to easily fabricate an opposition to Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nA few people were suprised at my claim that Donald Trump was killed in 2019. In early February (I incorrectly stated May before, I'm still human), a group of Neo-Nazis kidnapped and killed Trump. Officially, their motive was Trump's rhetoric in the 2016 campaign being harsher than his actions, but unofficially, his presidency was a disaster. Do you think it's a coincidence that in early April, soon after the government took over, replacing the incompetent Trump, it was reported that \"Trump\" was on track to pass his deregulation goal by 31 times according to the Washington Examiner? \n\nNow after this, the chief Oligarch, none other than former Vice President Joe Biden decided it was time to stop operating from the shadows and directly take the reins of power. He ran against a \"Trump\" that everyone despised and won easily? He then orchestrated Jan 6th to defame their cause further and to make more people support him. Now, he wishes to return to the shadows after 1 term through appearing weak and stupid, then controlling both candidates in the next election. He made sure that none of them could ever become too powerful. Trump is (il)legally dead and his words are controlled by Joe, while Harris is a junior fire-fighter who has had no experience with politics, and was just picked up off the streets to become a puppet of the government. No matter who wins, this is just Biden's 4th term. All of this, again, to present the lie that the centre is working perfectly fine. Joe wishes to sap the power he can get from the collapsing democracy and escape, leaving the US to radical groups and violence. In a 2 party system, both parties become complacent eith always being elected, become indistinguishable, and once they start ignoring the common man, because they know they will always be the next elected, the common man turns to radical, hateful ideologies. Joe Biden is perhaps the only man who alone can fix this, but instead he wishes to lie about the 2 party system still controlling the majority of the nation, to slow the spread of these fringe ideological groups, rather than treat the US population like he cares and keep the parties alive.\n\nThe centre must hold. We must do anything in our power to stop this corrupt erosion of the natural order or politcal moderation, to free ourselves from the 2 parry binary and neuter parties and movements that seek only to kill and loot, including neo-nazis and hard-line communists.\n\nI hope you heed my warning, and thank you for listening.",

        "Text": "With the U.S. election coming up, it\u2019s worth understanding the positions of each candidate on issues impacting Palestine. While both candidates have taken different stances, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump approach the Israel-Palestine conflict with noticeably different priorities.\n\nDonald Trump has consistently demonstrated strong support for Israel, especially through actions and statements since October. \n\n* [Recently, he proposed new policies that include barring entry to individuals from areas he considers \u201csecurity threats,\u201d **including Gaza**, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-vows-expand-travel-ban-gaza-rcna120711)\n* He [also announced intentions to send deportation officers to U.S. protests he deems \u201cpro-Hamas,](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/trumps-plan-quell-protests-deport-hamas-radicals-rcna166168)\u201d a term that\u2019s broad and could easily be applied to many forms of Palestine support.\n\n* In an interview with Fox News, Trump said, \u201c[We need to protect Israel. There is no choice](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6338927770112),\u201d signaling a lack of openness to calls for de-escalation. \n\n* [The Trump Administration deviated from a 1978 State Department legal opinion that held Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are \u201cinconsistent with international law.\u201d](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-politics-west-bank-3da4fb3671004679a91a7d4ae9ab4e57\\))\n\n* [The Trump Administration cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees \\(UNRWA\\)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-administration-cuts-funding-united-nations-palestinian-refugee-agency-n905616\\))\n\n* He said \"[Actually, Israel is the one \\(that wants to keep going\\), and you should let them go and let them finish the job. He \\(Biden\\) doesn\u2019t want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian. He's a weak one.\u201d]\n(https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-criticized-palestinian-insult-debate-with-biden-2024-06-28/)\n\n* [He said : \"He\u2019s doing a good job,\u201d Trump said about the Israeli leader. \u201cBiden is trying to hold him back, just so you understand, Biden is more superior to the V.P. He\u2019s trying to hold him back, and he probably should be doing the opposite, actually. I\u2019m glad that \\[Netanyahu\\] decided to do what he had to do, but it\u2019s moving along pretty good\"](https://newrepublic.com/post/187332/trump-biden-tough-netanyahu)\n\n* He has continued to highlight his past actions, like [moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights) and [recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights). \n\n* [Trump told Netanyahu to \"Do what you have to do\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/trump-netanyahu-support-gaza-lebanon/)\n\n* [Trump stated that the U.S. should let the conflict \u201cplay out.\u201d\n](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4304401-trump-israel-hamas-war-let-things-play-out/)\n\n**His policies underline his clear alignment with Israeli interests.**\n\n\nKamala Harris, who is now leading the Democratic ticket after Biden stepped down, has taken a different approach. \n\n* [ She has called for peace and an immediate ceasefire, emphasizing protection and dignity for Palestinians, and added that \"what has happened in Gaza in the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking\"](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc).\n\n* [She was against the Israeli invasion of Rafah](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-rafah-gaza-tiktok.html\\))  \n\n* While she hasn\u2019t suggested specific policies like defunding Israel, she has spoken more[ broadly and extensively about the need for de-escalation and security for civilians in the region](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1234822836/kamala-harris-benny-gantz-gaza-cease-fire-israel-hamas).\n\nAs the campaign progresses, **Harris may be limited by the demands of a close race, but her emphasis on dialogue and restraint stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s** more unilateral support for Israel. For those watching the U.S. election with Palestine in mind, these are key points to consider.\n\nAs the race is expected to be close, with Trump leading in many polls, **keep in mind that a vote for a third-party candidate would likely have the effect of boosting Trump's chances.**\n\n**Much of this information and more straight facts on the candidates positions on Israel/Gaza can be found on [this page created by the Arab American Institute](https://www.aaiusa.org/president-issues/kamala-harris-on-palestine)**",

        "Text": "Those who have equated Donald Trumps rhetoric and demeanor with other the rise of other authoritarian leaders throughout history have always been met with responses like \"You just don't *like him* or *Orange man bad!\"*, but in light of recent statement he has made *Himself* please reconsider the effect his re-election may have on America going forward. Consider these FACTS;\n\nTrump Said \u2018I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had,\u2019 -Multiple Witnesses and ex-chief of staff.\n\nJohn Kelly, his former White House Chief of Staff claimed that Trump praised Hitler, \u201cYou know, Hitler did some good things too.\u201d\n\nTrump's then-wife Ivana said that Trump owned Mein Kampf and a book of Hitler's speeches and read from them \"occasionally\".\n\n\"Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of 'Mein Kampf,' and he's a Jew,\"\n\nDavis told the writer, \u201cI did give him a book about Hitler\"... \"but I\u2019m not Jewish\"\n\nIn a 1990 Playboy interview, Trump claimed that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped end the Cold War, did not have  \u201ca firm enough hand\u201d to deal with pro-democracy demonstrators. Russia is out of control and the leadership knows it. That\u2019s my problem with Gorbachev. Not a firm enough hand,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout Kim Jong-Un, \u201cAt a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I\u2019m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle (Whom he had killed) or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he\u2019s a pretty smart cookie,\u201d Trump told NBC in 2017.\n\nIn describing is plans for America he referenced his admiration for Kim Jung Un \"He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.\"\n\n\"Why can't we just shoot them in the legs\" regarding DC protesters.\n\nIt's been called hyperbole to state that Trumps next presidency may have Hitlerian outcomes but please consider that in 1933 a slim majority who at that time considered Hitler to be a champion of the people carried him to victory. One checkbox stands between us and the worst possible outcomes for this country. Please in the best interest of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The justices that he put in the Supreme Court have already said he has full immunity for anything he does as official acts and periphery acts as President, leaving lots of room for interpretation as to what that means. Republicans in Congress are so scared of his supporters canceling them that they do whatever Trump asks, even when he isn't in power. He plans on firing any federal employees who didn't vote for him and even started to at the end of his term. And he's gotten rid of anyone willing to stand up to him and tell him what he wants to do is a bad idea, which we're learning now is how some of his worst impulses were tamped down during his presidency. \n\nIf any Democrat presidential nominee were saying and doing these same things, you would be screaming from the rooftops about how dangerous they are. Think about it that way and maybe you'll see why so many Americans are worried about him winning.",

            "Good! Then you must be of the opinion that President Trump is not a fascist, a Nazi or the next Hitler, because it was certainly justified in WWII to kill them.\n\nThat admission at least tells me that you are a rational person because only the rabidly ignorant on the far left truly believe Trump is a fascist, a Nazi or the next Hitler. \n\nNow let me educate you:\n\nJeffrey Goldberg wrote the piece in The Atlantic claiming that Trump made racist and disparaging remarks about a murdered Army private whose funeral he had paid for out of his own pocket. Goldberg\u2019s citation was : \u2018according to two people present at the meeting\u2019 yet he did not name them. It\u2019s important here to note that Goldberg wrote a piece in 2020 claiming that Trump called soldiers \u2018suckers and losers\u2019, again using an unarmed source. We know that two dozens people were in the room at the time, almost all of whom **went on the record by name** to say the quote was never said. In legitimate journalism, stories aren\u2019t printed unless there are at least three legitimate sources who can corroborate the story and the other side is offered a chance do verify or rebut. \n\n\nI know liberal extremists *want* these salacious stories to be true but you\u2019re not being honest with yourself if you publicly profess that you truly believe them to be true.",

(And, in that instance, Contemporaneous notes means physical notes that were documented at the time of the meeting and requested through an FOIA request. So, yeah\u2026 you\u2019re wrong there. It\u2019s more than just two anonymous people, there\u2019s written documentation that was saved by and for the national archives.)\n\nSecond, the quote about wishing he had \u2018*generals like hitlers*\u2019 comes directly from **Former General and Trumps former Chief of Staff John Kelly** who is *[on record](https://youtu.be/ruGkcVv_tUI)* saying this. He\u2019s not anonymous and he was in the room with Trump.\n\nStop jumping through mental hoops to defend a guy who vocalizes idolizing Hitler.",
            "In light of the information I provided, that there is absolute proof that Trump is a fascist and idolizes hitler and other dictators and it was provided by none-other-than Four Star General and John Kelly. Does that change *your* opinion at all, or you still going with the guy who idolizes hitler, per a former general/Trumps former Chief of Staff?\n\nBecause, literally your whole argument was about you not believing any of this because it came from an anonymous source\u2026 and **none of that was true**.",
            "Uh oh, now [*more than a a dozen other former Trump officials* have signed an open letter in **agreement** with John Kelly\u2019s words](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4953059-trump-john-kelly-fascist/). More people who were in the room citing that what Kelly is saying is a correct assertion.\n\nThat\u2019s even MORE non-anonymous people agreeing and saying the same things from Trumps cabinet.\n\nHave you changed your mind yet\u2026 or is idolizing and wanting to be like hitler still *not enough* to make you question your allegiance?",

        "Title": "Here's the problem JD Vance's debate performance - It was a for a Presidential candidate that does NOT exist - Plus Gaslighting and Infanticide",
        "Text": "Tim Walz gave an ok debate with a strong strong finish. The problem is everyone knows what January 6th was and who was responsible for it. For many Americans, January 6th, is probably the most damning admonishment of Donald Trump. There will be many Americans that vote for him regardless.\n\nIn this way, the only thing that really matters are the actual policies and issues that both parties have to run on. For women, reproductive rights are a paramount issue. Let's be clear, JD Vance's answer was a pure psychological operation, aka psyops, of misdirection and outright lies.\n\nInitially, JD started off insinuating that democrats want to legalize killing alive infants after they are born. This is the second time I watched this debate cycle where the insane notion that you can kill an infant after birth was left unchecked by common sense law. For christ sakes it is lex naturalis.\n\nTo be clear Donald Trump's exact accusation was, \"execution after birth\" which is illegal in every state. JD Vance insinuated that accusation in this debate with Minnesota's abortion law which clearly does NOT say that you can kill an infant after it is born which is infanticide and is illegal and considered homicide. Why can't Democrats see the insinuation being applied here as ridiculous? Why is this a Republican talking point as if it is true? It's a bizarre exchange I have seen 2 times now. Another missed opportunity to make things clear.\n\nHere's the thing about lies, they're told because the liar believes people will believe them. A pathological liar themselves believes their own lies which makes detecting their lies by a person listening to them more difficult to detect. Donald Trump exhibits signs of being a pathological liar while JD Vance isn't pathological in his lies; although, if you can continue into Trump world that may begin to change. No, JD Vance is calculated in his lies and it's easy to tell; in my opinion.\n\nIt gets better as JD continues on that he is for family values and completely denied saying he wants a federal abortion ban. The problem is that this is what Republicans want and have created a court to fulfil this mission and overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nHere's what JD said on the debate stage:\n\n>\u201cI never supported a national ban. I did, during when I was running for Senate in 2022, talk about setting some minimum national standard. For example, we have a partial-birth abortion ban \u2026 in place in this country at the federal level. I don\u2019t think anybody is trying to get rid of that, or at least, I hope not, though I know the Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance,\u201d Vance said.\n\nThe problem is, the \"very radical pro-abortion stance\" Republicans are implying is worse than a partial birth abortion ban in the fact that are implying democrats are for killing infants after birth. I mean holy shit lol am I in the twilight zone? What a statement that is.\n\nNO sane American is for Infanticide. Nobody. Again, I don't know why democrats are not seeing this gaslighting but it's almost as if it is so crazy and insane that they are not believing that the statements are seriously resonating with any American watching these debate interactions.\n\nTo be clear Republicans and Donald Trump are trying to combat the abortion, Women's Right to Choose, debate with the notion that democrats are for killing infants after they are born.\n\nCordial be damned. The same passion should have been vigorously responded to as was Tim Walz's response to the nonsense that there was a peaceful transitions on, get ready for it, not on January 6th but on January 20th... Which is laughable that in order to gaslight that one on the American public you had to literally change the dates. Again, JD *knows* the lies he is repeating.\n\nIf there is a clear thread that should be pushed after this debate and in general for this upcoming election is not lies but gaslighting which is worse than lying. It's lies plus the added benefit of psychological deception in order to make your victim question what is right or wrong in hopes they can be convinced that the thing they are siding with is justifiably cogent.\n\nIn Donald Trump's house of lies this is what you can expect.

Trump is literally trying to continue 2020 starting RIGHT NOW after he admitted he lost \"by a WHISKER\" and retracted that during the debate.",
        "Text": "Literally, the proud boys, Q, and the KKK aren't going to let it go that what the president said along with Laura Loomer is outright insanity.\n\nI want to be clear, this is starting to become a scary development. The reason why this is so alarming is because Trump didn't do this in 2016. At that time if he lost against Hillary Clinton I think he would have ran again but I don't think it would of been in any way the fever pitch national chaos in the way he did in 2020.\n\nThis is now being fully telegraphed and it started (well, it started in 2020) during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris.\n\nPrior to the debate, Nick Fuentes came out with a tweet in response to a report that Donald Trump admitted to losing the election by a whisker. No, I am not making it up that he said, \"I lost by a whisker\". You can't make this stuff up.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526)\n\nWhat Nick said in the tweet was this amongst other supporters being enraged.\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/)\n\n[https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html](https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html)\n\n**Here is Nick's quote.**\n\n>\"So, why did we do Stop the Steal? Why did anyone go to Jan. 6? Why did any one go to jail? ... It would have been good to know that before 1,600 people got charged,\" Fuentes said\u00a0**on his podcast**, referring to the criminal charges for those who invaded and ransacked the Capitol. \"It would\u2019ve been good to know that before I had all my money frozen, put on a no-fly list, banned from everything, lost all my bank and payment processing.\u201d\n\nNow, besides Nick being a white supremacist amongst other things I have to agree with the sentiment. It's pretty reasonable regardless of who it came from.\n\nThe weird part is what nobody was talking about in relation to the Harris / Trump debate. When ABC moderators asked Trump if he lost the election Trump went completely against the Lex Fridman interview and effectively retracted that he ever admitted to losing. I guess people were too busy laughing it up regarding Trump's gaffe regarding immigrants eating dogs and cats.\n\nTo me, this is a distraction to what is literally happening before our eyes. White supremacists are using Trump to start a civil war; AND, Trump is going right along with it.\n\nIf someone told Trump that he better follow along then there is no clearer example of the 72 hours or so that Trump went to admitting to a complete retraction. What's more odd is how fast Trump reversed and climbed right back into the racist and the worst of us political base.\n\nIt's as if Trump was willing to be \"more normal\" candidate when he was clearly in the winning category of the upcoming election. However, when it was becoming clear he was losing it's as if every guardrail has come off. He has fully surrounded himself with an absolute horrible person in Laura Loomer. She has gone so far as to not only suggest immigrants are eating pets via cats and dogs but also humans.\n\nMoreover, there has been bomb threats and now a deployment of Proud Boys descending on SpringField Ohio for the purpose of? WTF knows.\n\nWith all of this obviousness being thrown directly into our faces the Media is literally standing there and acting like everything is normal. It is so crazy, it is as if Trump is willing and ready to start January 6th again but right now. I don't even know if we will make it to the the election before something \"bad\" happens.\n\nAt what point is the media and Republican donors going to pull the rug and say this is absolutely not acceptable? Why is the media literally acting like this is even remotely normal.\n\nMy god, are we going to even make it to the election? I don't actually know at this point.",

            "First, there are only a few \"traditional\" Republicans left - anyone who voted for Trump in 2020 has lost the plot and that was tens of millions of people. \n\nSecondly, Trump is the culmination of conservative politics rather than a departure from it. He's just more blatant about it than previous Republicans were. \n\nAs for what will happen, they control the Supreme Court and enough of the Senate to continue stalling progress until the next Presidential election, so we keep doing this dance indefinitely.",
            "There's no real way to know for sure. It's going to be a tug of war between trying to keep the MAGA base while also trying to slowly return to traditional conservatism. Right now, we don't know which side will win. \n\nTrump's base is really devoted to him. I think that until at least the next election, Trump will continue to hold rallies, post on social media, and try to keep himself in the spotlight as much as possible. The only thing that will stop him is either jail or death.\n\nAfter that, either his base will slowly be absorbed back into the \"normal\" Republican party, or one of Trump's people (maybe one of his sons) will take over and continue.",
            "I am hoping that if Trump loses he rides off into the sunset (doubt this will happen because of his ego but one can hope). Then, maybe can get some sane Republicans back into office instead of the whack job super far rights that are coming out of the woodwork now. Then maybe we can get a functioning government for a change.",
            "America is mostly (60-70%) a neoliberal mono party. Mostly defined by Reagan, Clinton, and Obama, the American center is pro-capitalist, pro-globalist, pro-military, anti-tax, and community oriented. The MAGA movement is a majority of the minority party. It\u2019s maybe 35% of the electorate, or about 80% of Republicans. The problem is that the Senate, the House, the Presidential Electoral College, and (by extension) the Supreme Court are disproportionate in their representation of that minority demographic.\n\nMAGA - meaning the white American low-education voters aligned with the Evangelical bloc - will continue to exist as the majority bloc in the minority party unless the government is restructured, or the demographics of rural states change. Put another way, 20,000 voters in rural Pennsylvania and Georgia will continue to hold disproportionate power, and with microtargeting of misinformation via social media, they are the most cost-effective way to gain political dominance. So there\u2019s no reason for MAGA to disappear as it is the most cost-effective way for the GOP to retain power.\n\nEdit: added the House, as many states with gerrymandered districts affect the congressional balance of power.",
            ">Trump is the culmination of conservative politics\n\nNever lose sight of this. I'm already seeing a lot of people say \"don't blame conservatives for what Republicans have done,\" which is pure bullshit. The conservative establishment has done nothing but support, defend, and enable Donald Trump in his attempted destruction of American democracy. Do *not* let them walk away from it.",

        "Text": "The proven rapist Trump (see below) has been [joined by the Harris campaign](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-says-she-supports-eliminating-taxes-tips-like-trump-2024-08-11/) in a call to end federal taxes on tips. I get the allure. I was a tipped employee in the early '80s at the time of the last shift in federal policy from non-taxable to taxable.\n\nIn tandem with the above, we have businesses themselves pushing us to tip their employees. For example a major pizza company is running ads on television advancing the idea that if you tip their employees at the point of delivery, the company will take a certain amount off your next order. Tip jars for employees are endemic now: they're in convenience stores, at pick up counters, and more.\n\nI would argue the purpose behind all of this is to save the employer from having to properly compensate their employees in both salary and the associated payroll taxes that will help pay for that employee's Social Security and Medicare when the time comes. This push to tipping is being done to improve the profit margins and take home of the non-working investors and owners - not those who are forced to beg for tips.\n\nWe need a simple cogent argument against this push: The bosses don't want to pay you what you're worth, so they're going to turn your attention to the customers for that pay instead. Workers will lose, the business bosses and owners will win - that's all this is about.\n\nThis push to increase tipping is not being proposed or implemented to benefit the employee or customer.\n\nAnd now about that proven rapist Trump thing:\n\n*(trigger warning: the following court decisions contain extremely graphic and blunt descriptions of rape)*\n\n\"Consequently, the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused - indeed, raped - Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established and is binding in this case.\" See page 13 of the Judge's decision ...\u00a0[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf)\n\nMore questions about Donald J. Trump being a rapist?

There is no \"clean slate\" from which to build. \n\nThere is a cylicial nature to them and the candidates and the campaigns they run matter far less than most people are willing to understand. \n\nAOC is well positioned to grow her rank and seniority  in the House for the next decade or more. She's a fundraising powerhouse and enjoys representing one of the safest districts in Congress. With money alone she could recruit, run and win seats to add to her caucus. \n\nThis is how Pelosi, McConnel or anyone else on the Hill got to their positions of influence. AOC is not bigger than reality. She would be well advised to mirror Pelosi's assent if she ever wants to be a real player in the game. \n\nAs Pelosi correctly remarked about AOC - \"you might have 4 million followers, but you only have 4 votes.\"\n\nThe left needs to learn that collation building is the path to power - not whatever circular firing squad you and a million other snark bots feel empowered by.",
            "Yeah, they didn't need me to say, \"not Harris... the woman who dropped out before Iowa.... who campaigned in Georgia for 6 months and failed to rise in the polls at all\" when she was ~~nominated~~ selected. I was told something similarly after she predictably lost. It never seems to be the time to tell inconvenient truths. Mirrored the same things said to me by centrists when HRC lost. I studied this tactic in my propaganda class. It was called giving me the quietus, chilling internal deliberation of critical reasoning.\n\nDon't talk down to me about working on campaigns. I have a doctoral-level education in law and political science, and I've worked with many different campaigns on both sides of the aisle for a bit over 20 years. I agree elections don't exist in a vacuum. I don't give two shits if it's AOC or Bernie or freaking shoeonhead off youtube. We're in a populist era. Neo-classical liberalism nonsense has been discredited. It led to the rise of Trumpism and MAGA and more economic bubbles than anyone wants to think about. It has failed to provide for my interests for the majority of my adult life, so I am over acquiescing to the demands of the bad faith actors in the party. I will not vote for a centrist. Full stop. They can build a coalition with the imaginary sane Republicans that they seek to empower off my support, and I think my current lack of real representation won't really change much.\n\nSo, again, make comments about how I'm a bot all you want, alienate yet another potential voter, but know that with every one of these snide obnoxious bullying comments you are choosing MAGA going forward. So, hats off to you, MAGA promoter.",
            "1) I agree we are in a populist era - like most of the western world including LatAm. \n\n2) What was Harris to do? No lock up the nomination when she saw the opening? Anyone in her position would have done the same. \n\n3) Biden fucked us 2 years ago when he didn't open the Democrat Party to a primary. Incumbent president Dropping out 100 days before the election is unprecedented.\n\n4) Sure - I would have preferred to have had an open convention. Get Newsom, Mayor Pete and some other heavy hitters on the stage. But - to be clear: Bernie and AOC would have not been on that stage. Doesn't mean I like it. But the \"what-ifs\" are a fantasy as this point. An open convention would have been the most watched political event in recent history. It could have bolstered the Dems - but to be fair - it could have also been a bloodbath.",
            "You're looking at this election in a vacuum, and I know that this is part of a pattern: not really holding primaries, sandbagging progressives, promoting Republicans, etc. Let us not forget HRC and the pied piper strategy that she used to make Trump into something other than an unserious candidate. He wouldn't have ever been taken seriously enough to attain that office once\u2014much less twice\u2014but for the centrists' electoral malpractice.",

You should work on your reading comprehension skills.\n\nI have three degrees from three different tier 1 research institutions in Texas. All you have are some lies about working for Bernie, and a lack of civility as you've accused me of being a bot. So, without much further ado, I just want you to remember next time your chosen candidate loses (spoiler alert: 2028) that you're part of the problem. Your arrogance and lack of decency and lack of intelligence lead you to alienate people like me, then if you don't like what's going on, consider shutting the fuck up. Don't bother replying.

I understand that Kennedy might visit Romania to launch his new book and to suppport Mr Georgescu (who wrote its foreword)\n\nHe also doesn\\`t believe that the man landed on the Moon, among other conspiracies.\n\n* My first worry is that Mr Georgescu voters believe that Romania can thrive in isolation, out of any influence under the pretext of \"true\" independence, just like USA and if Trump supports Mr Georgescu it means he is not a victim of russian propaganda. Romania is not a big  power like USA, Russia or China. If we exit EU, and based on Mr Georgescu philosophies, I am afraid we will become an European North Korea version.\n* My second worry and theory is that Trump wants to use Romania as a negotiaton asset in the Russia - Ukraine conflict.

I think Dems had no way to stop them in 2020 other than to mess up one or more cheating campaigns.  I think Trump plans to expose only the part where Dems counter cheated against him, to preserve some form of democracy.

Well, IT'S RAPE, and that should be enough, right? But if that isn't enough, how about the reality that being a rapist is a character trait that has become the guiding post for Trump and his followers. Rapists rape for the power. It is a violent assault fully intended to give the rapist absolute authority over the victims.\n\nThis rape thing is important because it is a character trait and extends beyond an internal need to dominate and control. One need look no further than North Korea to see what the disgusting pig and proven rapist Trump's vision for our United States is ... and the Republican Party is salivating all over themselves to help the disgusting pig and proven rapist Trump achieve his dream.\n\nDon't be shy about public discussion of this rapist Trump topic. Trump believes he can grab your daughter by the pussy or your mom or your wife or your sister or aunt or grandmother all because Trump believes his (alleged) wealth and celebrity give him that privilege. [He restated this just a year and a half ago](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-deposition-doubles-access-hollywood-remarks-grabbing-women/story?id=99107636) (the jury heard him loud and clear - why won't you?).\n\n\"Consequently, the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused - indeed, raped - Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established and is binding in this case.\" See page 13 of the Judge's decision ...\u00a0[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf)\n\nMore questions about Donald J.

        "Text": "**Title: The Trumpian Odyssey: A Satirical Journey into the Land of the Golden Hair**\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land not so far away, a reality TV star with a penchant for gold-plated everything stumbled upon a magical portal known as the 2016 election. With the flick of his perfectly coiffed hair, he unleashed a whirlwind of tweets, promises, and slogans that would make even the most seasoned politicians do a double-take.\n\nIn this fantastical realm, where logic took a backseat and facts were mere suggestions, our hero, let\u2019s call him \u201cThe Donald,\u201d embarked on a quest to make \u201cAmerica Great Again\u201d\u2014a slogan that was as elusive as the mythical unicorn. With a trusty sidekick, the Twitter Bird, he soared through the skies of social media, spreading tales of building walls and banning tacos (or was it Muslims?).\n\nAs The Donald ascended to the throne, the world looked on in a mix of disbelief and hilarity. His press conferences became the stuff of legends\u2014where facts were optional, and the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d was thrown around like confetti at a parade. Who knew that the art of the deal also included dodging accountability and redefining what \u201ctruth\u201d really meant?\n\nAnd then came the international stage! With all the grace of a toddler on roller skates, he waltzed into meetings with world leaders, proclaiming himself the \u201cgreatest negotiator\u201d while threatening to unleash tariffs like they were confetti cannons at a birthday party. Alliances that took decades to forge were shaken like a snow globe, all while he bragged about his \u201cbigly\u201d achievements.\n\nBut the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was his climate policy\u2014or lack thereof. In a world already grappling with rising temperatures, The Donald decided that the best course of action was to deny the existence of climate change, declaring it a hoax invented by the Chinese. Because who needs a sustainable future when you can have a booming fossil fuel industry, right?\n\nAs the years rolled on, The Donald\u2019s antics transformed the political landscape into a circus\u2014complete with a cast of characters that would make even the most imaginative playwright weep with joy. From \u201calternative facts\u201d to \u201ccovfefe,\u201d the lexicon of absurdity expanded, leaving the world both bewildered and entertained.\n\nIn the end, as his presidency came to a close, one had to wonder: was this a cautionary tale or a comedy of errors? Perhaps it was both\u2014a reminder that in the theater of politics, sometimes the lines between satire and reality blur, leaving us all to ponder the true meaning of leadership in the age of The Donald.\n\nSo here\u2019s to the rise of Donald Trump: a wild ride filled with laughter, disbelief, and the occasional facepalm. May we learn from this chapter in history, ensuring that the next act is one where reason, empathy, and perhaps a little less gold take center stage.",

        "Text": "In a recent tweet, she warned her fellow Republicans in Congress that if any of them interfered with Matt Gaetz's appointment as the next Attorney General.  She said that if the Ethic Committee's report on Gaetz, she would do everything she could to release ALL reports regarding sexual misconduct allegations against the other Republicans that were kept quiet, including paying the accusers hush money that was funded by taxpayers.    \n  \nIt took me a minute to fully comprehend the different levels of evil and how morally bankrupt she is.   But she was at least complicit in keeping sexual assault allegations against fellow Republicans non-public but is more than willing to blackmail and threaten them to help a drug using sexual predator become the Attorney General of the United States.  That kind of evil makes my head spin.\n\nAlso, the fact that she is doing this to help Trump pursue his consolidation of power and eventual coup and attempt to establish a white Christian nationalist government just verifies that she is batshit crazy.  And the fact that she is still throwing herself at him after he has snubbed her time and time again verifies that she is dumb as dammit.",

The result gives the appearance of a very unified party with strong leadership when, in reality, it's just a ship of fools.\n\nThe democrats, on the other hand, have a VERY diverse base plus all the conservatives the republican party has driven away (I'm a moderate they've driven away).  It's literally impossible for the democratic party to create an agenda that everyone can fully support.  The democratic party has to embrace and educate it's base about the concept of compromise (within their party).  There can be no monolithic democratic agenda that will draw enough support to beat the republican party.  It has to be a generic set of guidelines with the voters understanding \"this isn't my ideal but it's a step in a better direction than the alternative.\"\n\nAlso, democrats have to deal with those pesky problems of facts and reality.  Intelligent voters tend to place importance on that.  Republicans have cast that away.",

        "Title": "Dedollarization (Part 3) \u2013 A Potential Path to Ending Dollar Hegemony",
        "Text": "In recent years, the concept of dedollarization has gained attention, yet it often seems more of an intellectual exercise than a plausible reality. I have written 2 articles on the same \u2013 one addressing if a reserve currency is needed at all ([https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1f7siwy/dedollarization\\_is\\_a\\_reserve\\_currency\\_needed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1f7siwy/dedollarization_is_a_reserve_currency_needed/)) and the second assessing what reserve currency options exist and an evaluation of the same ([https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1gpc7y9/dedollarization\\_part\\_2\\_criteria\\_and\\_options\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1gpc7y9/dedollarization_part_2_criteria_and_options_for/)). The conclusions I got to were that while the world does need a reserve currency, there is currently no viable replacement for the USD.\n\nUntil recently, I remained skeptical about dedollarization\u2019s feasibility. However, the recent US election has reshaped my perspective. While still unlikely, I now see potential paths emerging to reducing the dollar's hegemony, if not outright replacing it. Watched a video by Josh Faulks that talks about one such scenario, which I summarize below and provide my own assessment of the same.\n\n**Josh\u2019s take:**\n\nAccording to Faulks, US foreign policy has become increasingly unpredictable, and the dollar has been weaponized too frequently to serve geopolitical goals. With Trump\u2019s return to the White House, his anti-EU, anti-NATO, and anti-China rhetoric, combined with frequent tariff threats, could accelerate efforts to challenge the dollar's dominance. Faulks talks about a scenario where the EU and BRICS nations come together to form an alliance to reduce their reliance on the greenback.\n\nThe euro, already the world\u2019s second most significant currency (accounting for 20% of global reserves), could serve as a starting point. Instead of BRICS developing their own currency (which is a non-starter any way), Faulks suggests they might adopt the euro as part of a broader strategy. This could begin with trade agreements shifting from dollar-based transactions to euros, particularly in energy markets, where the dollar\u2019s dominance is most entrenched. A coordinated push from the EU and BRICS could lead to OPEC selling oil in euros, forcing central banks to diversify their reserves. This could undermine the dollar\u2019s global role, triggering inflation, a weakened dollar, and higher US interest rates to maintain capital inflows - potentially even a financial crisis. This could be followed by changes the alliance countries could enact to make America's financial system weaker.\n\nChallenges to this scenario include the ideological and cultural divides between democratic EU nations and authoritarian BRICS members like Russia and China. US retaliation is also a significant risk, especially under Trump. Other challenges exist too. Despite these obstacles, Faulks argues that the possibility of a rival to the dollar is higher today than ever before. And the path he talks about is not as tough as it sounds.\n\n**My assessment:**\n\nFaulks\u2019 scenario is plausible, in fact it is one of the more plausible pathways to dedollarization that I\u2019ve encountered. Many discussions around this topic focus on US debt or default risks, which feel unlikely to me given that other major economies face similar or worse fiscal challenges. However, while the scenario is plausible, the hurdles to this EU-BRICS alliance are enormous.\n\nFirst, the clash of values and cultures cannot be overstated. The EU, with its democratic institutions and rule-based governance, fundamentally differs from the autocratic regimes of Russia and China. Building trust and consensus between these polar opposites would be a herculean task. Second, the US has the capacity to counteract this alliance by favoring certain countries within the EU and BRICS, skillfully exploiting their self-interest. By effectively \"buying off\" these nations, the US could not only disrupt the cohesion of the EU-BRICS alliance but also sow discord within each bloc individually, leading to fragmentation and weakening their collective influence. Third, several EU nations are shifting to the right and may view Trump and his policies favorably, failing to recognize that these very policies could ultimately harm them significantly.\n\nMoreover, with Trump\u2019s admiration for authoritarianism, he could pivot to forming his own alliance with authoritarian-leaning nations such as Russia, Hungary, and even China, reshaping global power dynamics. If India, with its strategic importance and growing economy, aligns with this bloc, it could further isolate the EU, leaving it to face a significantly diminished role in global affairs. Additionally, the US\u2019s unparalleled military power serves as a potent deterrent, ensuring that any challenge to its economic influence comes at a potentially high cost.\n\nFinally, several logistical and structural hurdles of implementing a unified alternative to the dollar exist. The complexity of aligning monetary policies, establishing trusted mechanisms for trade, and creating a stable financial system that can rival the dollar requires immense coordination and time. Even minor missteps could lead to economic instability, further discouraging nations from pursuing such an alliance. In this context, the US holds several cards that it can play to not just maintain but strengthen its position as the dominant global economic power.\n\nThe potential benefits of an EU-BRICS alliance are undeniable. It could mark the end of American economic exceptionalism, fostering a multipolar financial system that is more diverse and resilient. This would shield the world from the whims of erratic US leadership, creating a more stable global order. But for this vision to succeed, the alliance will likely need to prioritize incremental progress over sweeping changes, ensure unified commitment from all, and develop strategies to withstand the tremendous headwinds it will face in this journey.\n\n",

Inflation and prices didn't soar in Trump's first go around....like Biden. 3.wellll....we can hope spending and taxes will be cut but every president has added to the debt. 4.corruption and cronyism?! Have you been paying attention the last 100 years? Should be better under trump then the last 50 years. 5.haha...unqualified people? Really, now you complain...Sam Brinton, Rachel Levine, mayor Pete, Jake Sullivan...the list of freaks and idiots goes on. 6.amplified anti American sentiment, ha..no one respects Biden or America now. Notice how south America is the new Chinese friend. Notice how Biden was put in the back row of the APEC. 7. Well if you want women killed that's fine, don't see any huge push for men only. I think women should also sign up for selective service. 8. Geezis...quit eating the gruel of impending climate doom ..I love how all the COP members flew to the summit on private jets and no one attacks China and India over their pollution...wow... hypocrites. 8.state controlled media..haaaaa...didn't happen the first time..ninnies...almost all the media is controlled by liberals...just a fact 9 labor crisis....ok, if you say, if deporting ILLEGAL immigrants will cause this then the solution is easy, we can let more illegally will work visas...legally! 10.de solarization sentiment.

Top Russian aid released a memo about them assisting him and him keeping his \"obligations\" (same day RT aired nude photos of Melania). I'm not saying he cheated to win BUT you better believe he will ensure no election is fair again. GOP will help him too. They will make it so Republicans win every time.",

            "No. The Republicans are too deep into fascism and the Democrats are trying way too hard to \"reach across the aisle\" and be seen enlightened centrists too good for the game of politics. Dems would never do anything that could maybe possibly kinda be seen as extreme or radical, especially since the morons on the right already say shit like \"the most radical left president in history\" about a diet Republican with absolutely no irony whatsoever. \n\nThe right won't listen to any valid criticisms or reason because they can all be dismissed as \"Trump derangement syndrome\" or something other nonsense boogeyman of the week. They've already decided how they feel, and thats all that matters. They've chosen to remain obdurate, no matter how much evidence is presented that disproves them. \n\nThe Dems aren't listening to the reasons Trump got elected, the things Trump supporters care about. They are too busy going after the low hanging fruit, calling them dum dums and such. Meanwhile, both sides of actual Americans are mad about the same sh*t. The working class has more in common with each other than rich/poor Dems and rich/poor Reps, and the sooner we realize that the sooner we could see the largest redistribution of wealth and power in modern history.\n\nBut we won't because the Dems have already decided the Reps are uneducated morons and the Reps have already decided the Dems are literal demons and pedophiles (again, no irony whatsoever). That's what fascism does. It creates in groups and out groups and makes uneasy alliances with conservative elites \"against their common enemy on the left\" (Paxton). Trump has successfully weaponized incompetence, fear, and ignorance. He has weaponized criticism such that any observation, however valid, is seen as a \"witch hunt\" by the big bad democwats who just hate him for no reason. \n\nMost importantly, though, is that Trump has effectively been deified. There are people who worship him like the literal second coming of Christ. You know how Christians get super butt hurt and pretend to be oppressed every time poor criticize the bibble or point out the many, MANY inconsistencies and contradictions? Trump is their bibble. He is their god, and democrats are literal demons from hell. This is not hyperbole.

        "Text": "Muslims in Michigan began seeing pro-Israel ads this fall praising Vice President Kamala Harris for marrying a Jewish man and backing the Jewish state. Jews in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, saw ads from the same group with the opposite message: Harris wanted to stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel.Another group promoted \u201cKamala\u2019s bold progressive agenda\u201d to conservative-leaning Donald Trump voters, while a third filled the phones of young liberals with videos about how Harris had abandoned the progressive dream. Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches.What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the group\u2019s efforts obtained by The Washington Post.The project, funded with anonymous donations, micro-targeted messages across the battleground states, often with ads that appeared to be something they were not \u2014 a tactic the organizers sometimes referred to internally as \u201cfalse positives.\u201dWith digital spots, direct mail, text messages, influencer marketing and mobile billboards, the overall project was a high-tech experiment in misdirection \u2014 an old political tactic that has been sharpened in recent decades with increasingly precise targeting techniques.Ads tested better if Muslims felt they were seeing a message meant for Zionists, \u201cBernie bros\u201d felt they were hearing from the far left, and \u201cZyn bros\u201d felt they were hearing from activists who wanted \u201ca world without gas-powered vehicles,\u201d a ban on fracking and affordable housing for undocumented Americans \u2014 policies Harris did not actually support during her campaign.\u201cThe worst part is Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth,\u201d said one of the ads, which was designed by Trump supporters to look as if it was advocating for leftist priorities like \u201cfree health care\u201d and a \u201cbreak on tuition.\u201dElon Musk speaks at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in New York on Oct. 27. A group of Musk political advisers funded a $45 million misdirection campaign targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)The entire effort grew out of research by Building America\u2019s Future, a conservative political nonprofit that was founded during the first Trump administration by Republican consultants Generra Peck and Phil Cox. With others at P2 Public Affairs, Peck and Cox, former advisers to DeSantis, were top strategists for a separate effort, America PAC, the super PAC funded by Musk to support Trump. Musk donated to Building America\u2019s Future in 2022, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The group\u2019s leaders have declined to comment on their donors.Starting in February, Ryan Tyson, a former pollster for DeSantis, began holding a series of about 25 focus groups with specific communities of targeted voters, with most of the research effort focused on likely Democrats who were uncertain about voting. The goal was to figure out how to help Donald Trump win during a campaign in which Democrats were vastly outspending Republicans on digital advertising\u2026\u2026.",

        "Text": "So I am not a Trump supporter. I was raised in a liberal family in a blue county in a blue state. I don\u2019t have too many Republicans in my inner circle but the ones that are do not have a favorable view of Trump. I want to see the line of thinking that leads one to vote for him. So I broke down Trump voters into 3 types of people. If you voted for him let me know what type you are. \n\n1. This is what I call \u201cTrump fans\u201d. These are the people who are buying MAGA hats, yard signs, etc. They are very excited to have him as president and there are very few people, if anyone that they would prefer as president. These people like him as a person and like his policies. \n2. People in this group don\u2019t like Trump as a person. They criticize him for some of the things he\u2019s done in his personal life. Maybe these people would\u2019ve preferred a different Republican like DeSantis or Nikki Haley  thinking they would be a better fit. However, they went with Trump because they like his policies. \n3. People in this group dislike his policies and dislike him as a person. However, they also dislike Harris\u2019s policies and/or her as a person. Therefore they had to pick the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d and decided that that was Trump.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1grax1i)",

            "I live in a red hot county in Western Pennsylvania. I made phone calls for every Democrat from Bill Clinton until this year. Trump fans hate entitlement moves. Biden's saying he was nominating a black woman for SCOTUS because she's a black woman didn't sit well. People won't admit they have racial attitudes or they have issues with voting for a woman president but they do. Bottom line: a lot of Trump's voters say they like him because he talks like they do. A lot of people don't like how politicians try to both sides their answers. Crude and disgusting comes off as \u201cauthentic\u201d for a lot of people.",
            "I think you are missing the primary demographic of Trump supporters.  Those who are tired of the continuing political bullshit and phoniness, and superfluous issues being the primary focus while the mechanics of a healthy economy and society are largely ignored.  \n\nThe career, embedded politicians and their political speak, and broken promises, is just sooooo tiring. The ineptitude of previous presidents like Obama and Biden are just another handful of straws on the camel's back. Ass kissing our enemies, and fighting hardest for fringe issues... pushing identity politics over all else.\n\nThere are people who want to be proud to be American, and proud of America. Who prefer a traditional state of things vs the craziness we've seen. Pretending that girls are boys and boys are girls.... and being viciously attacked if we don't play along.  Not that we care what you do in your own time... but it doesn't have to be the focus of our life too.",
            "Yeah I definitely noticed that. I just wanted to know how many people are \u201cTrump fans\u201d I guess. But our biggest winners in my lifetime at least were Trump and Obama. They both used the \u201canti establishment\u201d and \u201ctalking like the people\u201d strategy. The moderate candidate almost never seems to do well",
            "I was more trying to see whether his supporters had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him. I guess when I think of a Trump supporter I think of \u201cTrump fans\u201d. I know some people voted for him because they think he\u2019ll fix the economy and prefer tradition in terms of social issues. I wanted to know whether they are just conservative and prefer his policies to Harris but don\u2019t like him or if they actually like who he is as a person",
            "Contrary to what the political pundits said, I believe Bernie Sanders would have beaten Trump in 2016 or 2020.",
            "Your problem is that you are a liberal so your mind can't comprehend that there are other reasons to actually like Trump than the ones you came up with.\n\nPoint blank.... people are struggling in the current economy and they weren't under Trump.  On top of that, the current administration is pissing on people's legs and telling them that it's raining.... when they tell them how strong and great the economy is while people can barely afford food.\n\nTrump was president for 4 years once and things were good, and none of the horrible claims, from the left came true.",
            "Look I\u2019m not here for a debate. You are very unlikely to change my mind and I assume the same vice versa. I think your line of thinking is incorrect but I\u2019m not gonna waste my breath explaining that. I was simply trying to find out whether people who voted for him think that Donald Trump voted for him because they think he\u2019s a good person or despite the fact that he is not. I don\u2019t appreciate you making  assumptions about me either. Like I said I understand that you think he\u2019s going to help the economy. I don\u2019t know why you think I can\u2019t \u201ccomprehend\u201d why someone doesn\u2019t like him"

        "Text": "**Title: The Trumpian Odyssey: A Satirical Journey into the Land of the Golden Hair**\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land not so far away, a reality TV star with a penchant for gold-plated everything stumbled upon a magical portal known as the 2016 election. With the flick of his perfectly coiffed hair, he unleashed a whirlwind of tweets, promises, and slogans that would make even the most seasoned politicians do a double-take.\n\nIn this fantastical realm, where logic took a backseat and facts were mere suggestions, our hero, let\u2019s call him \u201cThe Donald,\u201d embarked on a quest to make \u201cAmerica Great Again\u201d\u2014a slogan that was as elusive as the mythical unicorn. With a trusty sidekick, the Twitter Bird, he soared through the skies of social media, spreading tales of building walls and banning tacos (or was it Muslims?).\n\nAs The Donald ascended to the throne, the world looked on in a mix of disbelief and hilarity. His press conferences became the stuff of legends\u2014where facts were optional, and the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d was thrown around like confetti at a parade. Who knew that the art of the deal also included dodging accountability and redefining what \u201ctruth\u201d really meant?\n\nAnd then came the international stage! With all the grace of a toddler on roller skates, he waltzed into meetings with world leaders, proclaiming himself the \u201cgreatest negotiator\u201d while threatening to unleash tariffs like they were confetti cannons at a birthday party. Alliances that took decades to forge were shaken like a snow globe, all while he bragged about his \u201cbigly\u201d achievements.\n\nBut the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was his climate policy\u2014or lack thereof. In a world already grappling with rising temperatures, The Donald decided that the best course of action was to deny the existence of climate change, declaring it a hoax invented by the Chinese. Because who needs a sustainable future when you can have a booming fossil fuel industry, right?\n\nAs the years rolled on, The Donald\u2019s antics transformed the political landscape into a circus\u2014complete with a cast of characters that would make even the most imaginative playwright weep with joy. From \u201calternative facts\u201d to \u201ccovfefe,\u201d the lexicon of absurdity expanded, leaving the world both bewildered and entertained.\n\nIn the end, as his presidency came to a close, one had to wonder: was this a cautionary tale or a comedy of errors? Perhaps it was both\u2014a reminder that in the theater of politics, sometimes the lines between satire and reality blur, leaving us all to ponder the true meaning of leadership in the age of The Donald.\n\nSo here\u2019s to the rise of Donald Trump: a wild ride filled with laughter, disbelief, and the occasional facepalm. May we learn from this chapter in history, ensuring that the next act is one where reason, empathy, and perhaps a little less gold take center stage.",

        "Text": "Muslims in Michigan began seeing pro-Israel ads this fall praising Vice President Kamala Harris for marrying a Jewish man and backing the Jewish state. Jews in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, saw ads from the same group with the opposite message: Harris wanted to stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel.Another group promoted \u201cKamala\u2019s bold progressive agenda\u201d to conservative-leaning Donald Trump voters, while a third filled the phones of young liberals with videos about how Harris had abandoned the progressive dream. Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches.What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the group\u2019s efforts obtained by The Washington Post.The project, funded with anonymous donations, micro-targeted messages across the battleground states, often with ads that appeared to be something they were not \u2014 a tactic the organizers sometimes referred to internally as \u201cfalse positives.\u201dWith digital spots, direct mail, text messages, influencer marketing and mobile billboards, the overall project was a high-tech experiment in misdirection \u2014 an old political tactic that has been sharpened in recent decades with increasingly precise targeting techniques.Ads tested better if Muslims felt they were seeing a message meant for Zionists, \u201cBernie bros\u201d felt they were hearing from the far left, and \u201cZyn bros\u201d felt they were hearing from activists who wanted \u201ca world without gas-powered vehicles,\u201d a ban on fracking and affordable housing for undocumented Americans \u2014 policies Harris did not actually support during her campaign.\u201cThe worst part is Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth,\u201d said one of the ads, which was designed by Trump supporters to look as if it was advocating for leftist priorities like \u201cfree health care\u201d and a \u201cbreak on tuition.\u201dElon Musk speaks at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in New York on Oct. 27. A group of Musk political advisers funded a $45 million misdirection campaign targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)The entire effort grew out of research by Building America\u2019s Future, a conservative political nonprofit that was founded during the first Trump administration by Republican consultants Generra Peck and Phil Cox. With others at P2 Public Affairs, Peck and Cox, former advisers to DeSantis, were top strategists for a separate effort, America PAC, the super PAC funded by Musk to support Trump. Musk donated to Building America\u2019s Future in 2022, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The group\u2019s leaders have declined to comment on their donors.Starting in February, Ryan Tyson, a former pollster for DeSantis, began holding a series of about 25 focus groups with specific communities of targeted voters, with most of the research effort focused on likely Democrats who were uncertain about voting. The goal was to figure out how to help Donald Trump win during a campaign in which Democrats were vastly outspending Republicans on digital advertising\u2026\u2026.",

This amendment (partially*) restored voting rights to convicted felons who have completed all of the terms of their sentence (including fines, fees etc). \n\nIf that Amendment had failed on the ballot, or if the Courts had struck it down, Donald Trump would not have been able to vote in this election or any other as long as he is a resident of Florida. \n\nAs with any law, it's more complicated than that.

I'd like to know if those laws have ever been challenged as unconstitutional at the federal level, but as of today they are law. \n\nA constitutional law to limit or deny convicted criminals the right to VOTE, but no restrictions on running for election, up to and including the highest office in the country.

        "Text": "This article Ive linked below explains it beautifully. Ironically its title, \"Wokeness has been comprehensively defeated in the US election,\" is wildly inaccurate. \n\nWokeness was not defeated at all. It is going to get stronger, and more intense, and cost the dems even more voters. \n\nIn fact, the comments to this very post will likely demonstrate this point. People will claim wokeness had nothing to do with the losses, and blame the whole thing on systemic racism, or some gender issue, or similar arguments. \n\n\"Wokeness caused the defeat of the democrats\" might be a more apt title. The dems were defeated, but the woke mob is not defeated at all. It will just get stronger, and make sure democrats have serious problems winning elections for the foreseeable future. \n\n\nhttps://www.standard.co.uk/comment/us-election-donald-trump-woke-blm-latinx-pronouns-critical-race-theory-defund-police-b1192637.html",

        "Title": "An Economic Reality for Democrats & Republicans",
        "Text": "Bernie Sanders released a statement yesterday following the election results that could not have been more accurate. The Democrat party have completely turned their backs on working families.  As 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, the DNC, Biden, and Kamala have continuously said the economy said was strong and healthy.\n\n  \nInflation & the economy were top issues in this presidential cycle for independent voters, which indicates their displeasure for the current estate of affairs. If inflation was low and the economy were strong, it wouldn't have been an issue. This led to hundreds of thousands of voters to cast their vote for Donald Trump, who has swayed them with his hopes and promises.\n\nThe reality is, Trump will not make this economy stronger in 4 years, it will be WEAKER. Trump's tax cuts will create a bigger deficit in our budget, along with the continuation of foreign aid to Israel. Harris would not have made this economy stronger either. This current economy is not solely the blame of Biden, its been a continuation of wasteful military spending and other reckless spending beginning with George W. Bush, now being passed back to Trump. The US has been lucky to not have been in a complete recession since then, simply the can is being kicked down the road. And the continuation of bank bailouts and corporate leaders in bed with the government will only make us WEAKER.\n\n  \nIf you are are Trump supporter, you need to recognize that Trump cannot fix this economy with his current plan. He wants to cut interest rates,  lower taxes, and maintain government spending, this is QE and inflationary.\n\n  \nIf you are a Harris supporter, you need to recognize that in certain places of our country currently people pay more in taxes than they do Norway, Sweden, Finland etc. Why is it that we pay more in taxes and do not have free education, healthcare, homeless programs like our friends in Europe? Hint: It's the government's mismanagement of funds.\n\n  \nI don't predict the US will have a better economy in the foreseeable future, it will have to create a Great Depression for any change to occur, because their needs to be DRASTIC change.\n\n  \nWhether you are friends of the RNC or DNC, federal government spending and management is a total disaster. If we want to be like our friends in Europe, we need leave the Federal Government with responsibility of the military, and allow State & Local governments more power to assist the people in need of their jurisdiction. \n\n  \nGovernment programs such as Trump's PPP loans, FEMA, student loans are part of the problem. If we simply got rid of our federal government student loan programs, tuition would drastically be less, if our tax money went to state & local governments and people want free education in their state, they should be able to vote and keep their local politicians accountable.\n\nDC cannot possibly be knowledgeable for the needs of people in Hawaii, Alaska, or Florida, however the local governments who are on the ground are. The problem with the US is the Federal government's lousy job in thinking they know what's right for its people, and wasteful spending on things the people did not ask for.\n\n  \nSo if you voted for Trump or Harris, our economy will be much more worse in 4 years than it is now. The stock market sky rocketing because of a Trump win yesterday, tells me people still don't get it.\n\n\n\n ",

A good qualified candidate would likely beat Trump any day of the week.\n\n  \nAnd the list that you provided is all great, but unlike our European friends our education & healthcare is not free, despite our citizens paying much more in Taxes. We cannot afford Tax Cuts, the federal government is bleeding red, this is part of the problem with the Trump Tax Plan.\n\nSimple the DNC or RNC does not offer any reasonable solutions to our economic problems. The only reason Trump won is because people were fooled he can make a difference, and tired of our current state of affairs. A Trump victory has pretty much secured a democrat in 2028 election, unless a republican that opposes Trump wins the primary, you can mark this one.",

        "Title": "The \"Delusions\"",
        "Text": "Once again, as in my first post, I will address the mythical government figures that were actually just fabrications. \n\nFirst of all, Barrack Obama. If you look into the inner depths of the US deep state (a phrase that I might remind the Fascist writers of Project 2025 appropriated to justify wanting to dissolve the department of education) you will find files detailing Czech President V\u00e1clav Klaus assassinating Obama on April 5th 2009. Hours after this, a body double was placed to hold a speech about nuclear weapons, to disguise the act.\n\nThis body double was brought back to the US, and assumed the role of President. Howevee, in late 2013, this body double would die of natural causes (just ask the staff of George Washington University Hospital). Unwilling to inform the public, advanced projection, deepfaking, and CGI technology was used to fabricate the next 3 years of the Obama presidency. To this day, the government occasionally brings out this Obama faker tech to major Democratic Party events such as this year's DNC. It shouldn't be surprising that it was current President Joe Biden who planned all of this, to disguise his secret takeover of power with a council of government officials, such as the secretary of state, treasurer, and speaker of the house (who used her and later his power in planning the house of representatives to unschedule and quell discussion about these facts).\n\nOnto another fabrication, this time being John McCain. It is amazing how far the US will go to conceal their actions. Now, John may be the most important. He was the first we know for sure. His faking set a precedent for the US to do similar actions, such as the previously mentioned Obamaspiracy. Now, John McCain might have actually been a real person. In one of my posts, I incorrectly stated there was no birth certificate, but since then I have done more digging, and God (calling me from a 1995 Nokia in Albania) has guided me. However, there is still a major gap in his life (1981-1987) that is preceded by strange circumstances in his home town just weeks before this gap of knowledge is thought to have started. Strange black vans and questions asked to the local populace. This gap started with John disappearing from the public eye and the death of his father (an assassination of an admiral orchestrated by the US government). Now it is unknown whether the actual John McCain was used as a puppet, being appointed a senator in 1987, or whether he was killed, his identity stolen, and used in the previously mentioned advanced technology, which the government has had since at least 1945, where they faked splitting an atom, an action physically impossible, to fake John's entire existence. Regardless, John McCain as we know him was a fabrication. He was not intended to win in 2008. There was serious ballot stuffing in Obama's favour, even with Obama still being the more popular candidate, to guarantee his already likely victory, since the government had no plans for John McCain to win.\n\nI'd like to quickly address another sidetrack from my first post. It doesn't matter who you vote for, but we can agree that Bill Clinton was a pathological liar. Not only did he target Hillary Clinton in a severe DA case that ended with her tragic death in the 90s, but then went on, hours later, to give his famous \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\" speech with a straight face. It's unnatural. There is no empathy for his actions in those eyes. Still in such recent memory as well for him. Horrific. Considering his radical centrist policies, I would not be suprised if he was also a fabrication, but this has just been hidden too well. Regardless, the government used a convenient figure they could dig up who they also knew everything about, Hillary, to easily fabricate an opposition to Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nA few people were suprised at my claim that Donald Trump was killed in 2019. In early February (I incorrectly stated May before, I'm still human), a group of Neo-Nazis kidnapped and killed Trump. Officially, their motive was Trump's rhetoric in the 2016 campaign being harsher than his actions, but unofficially, his presidency was a disaster. Do you think it's a coincidence that in early April, soon after the government took over, replacing the incompetent Trump, it was reported that \"Trump\" was on track to pass his deregulation goal by 31 times according to the Washington Examiner? \n\nNow after this, the chief Oligarch, none other than former Vice President Joe Biden decided it was time to stop operating from the shadows and directly take the reins of power. He ran against a \"Trump\" that everyone despised and won easily? He then orchestrated Jan 6th to defame their cause further and to make more people support him. Now, he wishes to return to the shadows after 1 term through appearing weak and stupid, then controlling both candidates in the next election. He made sure that none of them could ever become too powerful. Trump is (il)legally dead and his words are controlled by Joe, while Harris is a junior fire-fighter who has had no experience with politics, and was just picked up off the streets to become a puppet of the government. No matter who wins, this is just Biden's 4th term. All of this, again, to present the lie that the centre is working perfectly fine. Joe wishes to sap the power he can get from the collapsing democracy and escape, leaving the US to radical groups and violence. In a 2 party system, both parties become complacent eith always being elected, become indistinguishable, and once they start ignoring the common man, because they know they will always be the next elected, the common man turns to radical, hateful ideologies. Joe Biden is perhaps the only man who alone can fix this, but instead he wishes to lie about the 2 party system still controlling the majority of the nation, to slow the spread of these fringe ideological groups, rather than treat the US population like he cares and keep the parties alive.\n\nThe centre must hold. We must do anything in our power to stop this corrupt erosion of the natural order or politcal moderation, to free ourselves from the 2 parry binary and neuter parties and movements that seek only to kill and loot, including neo-nazis and hard-line communists.\n\nI hope you heed my warning, and thank you for listening.",

Consider these FACTS;\n\nTrump Said \u2018I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had,\u2019 -Multiple Witnesses and ex-chief of staff.\n\nJohn Kelly, his former White House Chief of Staff claimed that Trump praised Hitler, \u201cYou know, Hitler did some good things too.\u201d\n\nTrump's then-wife Ivana said that Trump owned Mein Kampf and a book of Hitler's speeches and read from them \"occasionally\".\n\n\"Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of 'Mein Kampf,' and he's a Jew,\"\n\nDavis told the writer, \u201cI did give him a book about Hitler\"... \"but I\u2019m not Jewish\"\n\nIn a 1990 Playboy interview, Trump claimed that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped end the Cold War, did not have  \u201ca firm enough hand\u201d to deal with pro-democracy demonstrators. Russia is out of control and the leadership knows it. That\u2019s my problem with Gorbachev. Not a firm enough hand,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength,\u201d he added.\n\nAbout Kim Jong-Un, \u201cAt a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I\u2019m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle (Whom he had killed) or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he\u2019s a pretty smart cookie,\u201d Trump told NBC in 2017.\n\nIn describing is plans for America he referenced his admiration for Kim Jung Un \"He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.\"\n\n\"Why can't we just shoot them in the legs\" regarding DC protesters.\n\nIt's been called hyperbole to state that Trumps next presidency may have Hitlerian outcomes but please consider that in 1933 a slim majority who at that time considered Hitler to be a champion of the people carried him to victory. One checkbox stands between us and the worst possible outcomes for this country. Please in the best interest of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

All they have to do is flatter him and he'll \n\nHe provided the names of American spies to our competitors, who then suspiciously disappeared. \n\nHe stole sensitive documents and sold them to our competitors. \n\nHe lies about things we can see with our own eyes...a sign of fascism. \n\nHe violated the emoluments clause of the US Constitution because he thinks the constitution is worth toilet paper. \n\nThe current issues American face are due to corporatism - - companies taking record profits  and blaming inflation. If it were really inflation, they wouldn't be able to deliver record profits. Trump loves corporatism. \n\nPerhaps you could describe why you think he'd  be better when it's clear he is an ugly, fat, smelly lying charleton who cares only about himself. He didn't even care that insurrectionists were willing to murder his vice president. What in earth makes you think he cares about you or America? \n\nI'm sorry the education system has failed you. Or maybe mommy loved your brother more than you because she didn't like girls. But you can do better. Just try.\n\nEdited to add: https://www.reddit.com/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1g0yp7y/its_true/",

        "Title": "Here's the problem JD Vance's debate performance - It was a for a Presidential candidate that does NOT exist - Plus Gaslighting and Infanticide",
        "Text": "Tim Walz gave an ok debate with a strong strong finish. The problem is everyone knows what January 6th was and who was responsible for it. For many Americans, January 6th, is probably the most damning admonishment of Donald Trump. There will be many Americans that vote for him regardless.\n\nIn this way, the only thing that really matters are the actual policies and issues that both parties have to run on. For women, reproductive rights are a paramount issue. Let's be clear, JD Vance's answer was a pure psychological operation, aka psyops, of misdirection and outright lies.\n\nInitially, JD started off insinuating that democrats want to legalize killing alive infants after they are born. This is the second time I watched this debate cycle where the insane notion that you can kill an infant after birth was left unchecked by common sense law. For christ sakes it is lex naturalis.\n\nTo be clear Donald Trump's exact accusation was, \"execution after birth\" which is illegal in every state. JD Vance insinuated that accusation in this debate with Minnesota's abortion law which clearly does NOT say that you can kill an infant after it is born which is infanticide and is illegal and considered homicide. Why can't Democrats see the insinuation being applied here as ridiculous? Why is this a Republican talking point as if it is true? It's a bizarre exchange I have seen 2 times now. Another missed opportunity to make things clear.\n\nHere's the thing about lies, they're told because the liar believes people will believe them. A pathological liar themselves believes their own lies which makes detecting their lies by a person listening to them more difficult to detect. Donald Trump exhibits signs of being a pathological liar while JD Vance isn't pathological in his lies; although, if you can continue into Trump world that may begin to change. No, JD Vance is calculated in his lies and it's easy to tell; in my opinion.\n\nIt gets better as JD continues on that he is for family values and completely denied saying he wants a federal abortion ban. The problem is that this is what Republicans want and have created a court to fulfil this mission and overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nHere's what JD said on the debate stage:\n\n>\u201cI never supported a national ban. I did, during when I was running for Senate in 2022, talk about setting some minimum national standard. For example, we have a partial-birth abortion ban \u2026 in place in this country at the federal level. I don\u2019t think anybody is trying to get rid of that, or at least, I hope not, though I know the Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance,\u201d Vance said.\n\nThe problem is, the \"very radical pro-abortion stance\" Republicans are implying is worse than a partial birth abortion ban in the fact that are implying democrats are for killing infants after birth. I mean holy shit lol am I in the twilight zone? What a statement that is.\n\nNO sane American is for Infanticide. Nobody. Again, I don't know why democrats are not seeing this gaslighting but it's almost as if it is so crazy and insane that they are not believing that the statements are seriously resonating with any American watching these debate interactions.\n\nTo be clear Republicans and Donald Trump are trying to combat the abortion, Women's Right to Choose, debate with the notion that democrats are for killing infants after they are born.\n\nCordial be damned. The same passion should have been vigorously responded to as was Tim Walz's response to the nonsense that there was a peaceful transitions on, get ready for it, not on January 6th but on January 20th... Which is laughable that in order to gaslight that one on the American public you had to literally change the dates. Again, JD *knows* the lies he is repeating.\n\nIf there is a clear thread that should be pushed after this debate and in general for this upcoming election is not lies but gaslighting which is worse than lying. It's lies plus the added benefit of psychological deception in order to make your victim question what is right or wrong in hopes they can be convinced that the thing they are siding with is justifiably cogent.\n\nIn Donald Trump's house of lies this is what you can expect. Deception that comes in a beautiful glass ampoule of a sweet smelling scent of roses.\n\nThe problem is when you spray it and the scent wears off it's all a perfume of bullshit.\n\nThe democrats need to explain this a whole lot better or risk losing this election in a landslide.\n\nJD Vance gave a pretty slick performance for a republican presidential candidate that doesn't exist in Donald Trump. American's can't be fooled, unless you let it happen. Right now the democrats are letting it happen as of now. ",

Republicans would pass that and it wouldn't affect laws in states that offer a longer window of time.\n\nHere in Wisconsin, there's no abortion access outside of rape, incest & medical necessity.\n\nIf Democrats were willing to compromise, women in Wisconsin would be able to get first trimester abortions, which are the overwhelming majority of all abortions.\n\nDemocrats refuse to compromise on campaigning issues, because solved problems don't bring in campaign donations.  That's why states with abortion bans will never see change.  If a proposal puts restrictions on late-term abortion, Democrats will choose to leave the full ban in place.\n\nThis is the reason why Wisconsin is stuck with an abortion ban *that predates the civil war.*  Democrats prefer campaign donations over compromise and solutions.",

Trump is literally trying to continue 2020 starting RIGHT NOW after he admitted he lost \"by a WHISKER\" and retracted that during the debate.",
        "Text": "Literally, the proud boys, Q, and the KKK aren't going to let it go that what the president said along with Laura Loomer is outright insanity.\n\nI want to be clear, this is starting to become a scary development. The reason why this is so alarming is because Trump didn't do this in 2016. At that time if he lost against Hillary Clinton I think he would have ran again but I don't think it would of been in any way the fever pitch national chaos in the way he did in 2020.\n\nThis is now being fully telegraphed and it started (well, it started in 2020) during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris.\n\nPrior to the debate, Nick Fuentes came out with a tweet in response to a report that Donald Trump admitted to losing the election by a whisker. No, I am not making it up that he said, \"I lost by a whisker\". You can't make this stuff up.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526)\n\nWhat Nick said in the tweet was this amongst other supporters being enraged.\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/)\n\n[https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html](https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html)\n\n**Here is Nick's quote.**\n\n>\"So, why did we do Stop the Steal? Why did anyone go to Jan. 6? Why did any one go to jail? ... It would have been good to know that before 1,600 people got charged,\" Fuentes said\u00a0**on his podcast**, referring to the criminal charges for those who invaded and ransacked the Capitol. \"It would\u2019ve been good to know that before I had all my money frozen, put on a no-fly list, banned from everything, lost all my bank and payment processing.\u201d\n\nNow, besides Nick being a white supremacist amongst other things I have to agree with the sentiment. It's pretty reasonable regardless of who it came from.\n\nThe weird part is what nobody was talking about in relation to the Harris / Trump debate. When ABC moderators asked Trump if he lost the election Trump went completely against the Lex Fridman interview and effectively retracted that he ever admitted to losing. I guess people were too busy laughing it up regarding Trump's gaffe regarding immigrants eating dogs and cats.\n\nTo me, this is a distraction to what is literally happening before our eyes. White supremacists are using Trump to start a civil war; AND, Trump is going right along with it.\n\nIf someone told Trump that he better follow along then there is no clearer example of the 72 hours or so that Trump went to admitting to a complete retraction. What's more odd is how fast Trump reversed and climbed right back into the racist and the worst of us political base.\n\nIt's as if Trump was willing to be \"more normal\" candidate when he was clearly in the winning category of the upcoming election. However, when it was becoming clear he was losing it's as if every guardrail has come off. He has fully surrounded himself with an absolute horrible person in Laura Loomer. She has gone so far as to not only suggest immigrants are eating pets via cats and dogs but also humans.\n\nMoreover, there has been bomb threats and now a deployment of Proud Boys descending on SpringField Ohio for the purpose of? WTF knows.\n\nWith all of this obviousness being thrown directly into our faces the Media is literally standing there and acting like everything is normal. It is so crazy, it is as if Trump is willing and ready to start January 6th again but right now. I don't even know if we will make it to the the election before something \"bad\" happens.\n\nAt what point is the media and Republican donors going to pull the rug and say this is absolutely not acceptable? Why is the media literally acting like this is even remotely normal.\n\nMy god, are we going to even make it to the election? I don't actually know at this point.",

            "First, there are only a few \"traditional\" Republicans left - anyone who voted for Trump in 2020 has lost the plot and that was tens of millions of people. \n\nSecondly, Trump is the culmination of conservative politics rather than a departure from it. He's just more blatant about it than previous Republicans were. \n\nAs for what will happen, they control the Supreme Court and enough of the Senate to continue stalling progress until the next Presidential election, so we keep doing this dance indefinitely.",
            "There's no real way to know for sure. It's going to be a tug of war between trying to keep the MAGA base while also trying to slowly return to traditional conservatism. Right now, we don't know which side will win. \n\nTrump's base is really devoted to him. I think that until at least the next election, Trump will continue to hold rallies, post on social media, and try to keep himself in the spotlight as much as possible. The only thing that will stop him is either jail or death.\n\nAfter that, either his base will slowly be absorbed back into the \"normal\" Republican party, or one of Trump's people (maybe one of his sons) will take over and continue.",
            "I am hoping that if Trump loses he rides off into the sunset (doubt this will happen because of his ego but one can hope). Then, maybe can get some sane Republicans back into office instead of the whack job super far rights that are coming out of the woodwork now. Then maybe we can get a functioning government for a change.",
            "America is mostly (60-70%) a neoliberal mono party. Mostly defined by Reagan, Clinton, and Obama, the American center is pro-capitalist, pro-globalist, pro-military, anti-tax, and community oriented. The MAGA movement is a majority of the minority party. It\u2019s maybe 35% of the electorate, or about 80% of Republicans. The problem is that the Senate, the House, the Presidential Electoral College, and (by extension) the Supreme Court are disproportionate in their representation of that minority demographic.\n\nMAGA - meaning the white American low-education voters aligned with the Evangelical bloc - will continue to exist as the majority bloc in the minority party unless the government is restructured, or the demographics of rural states change. Put another way, 20,000 voters in rural Pennsylvania and Georgia will continue to hold disproportionate power, and with microtargeting of misinformation via social media, they are the most cost-effective way to gain political dominance. So there\u2019s no reason for MAGA to disappear as it is the most cost-effective way for the GOP to retain power.\n\nEdit: added the House, as many states with gerrymandered districts affect the congressional balance of power.",

        "Text": "The proven rapist Trump (see below) has been [joined by the Harris campaign](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-says-she-supports-eliminating-taxes-tips-like-trump-2024-08-11/) in a call to end federal taxes on tips. I get the allure. I was a tipped employee in the early '80s at the time of the last shift in federal policy from non-taxable to taxable.\n\nIn tandem with the above, we have businesses themselves pushing us to tip their employees. For example a major pizza company is running ads on television advancing the idea that if you tip their employees at the point of delivery, the company will take a certain amount off your next order. Tip jars for employees are endemic now: they're in convenience stores, at pick up counters, and more.\n\nI would argue the purpose behind all of this is to save the employer from having to properly compensate their employees in both salary and the associated payroll taxes that will help pay for that employee's Social Security and Medicare when the time comes. This push to tipping is being done to improve the profit margins and take home of the non-working investors and owners - not those who are forced to beg for tips.\n\nWe need a simple cogent argument against this push: The bosses don't want to pay you what you're worth, so they're going to turn your attention to the customers for that pay instead. Workers will lose, the business bosses and owners will win - that's all this is about.\n\nThis push to increase tipping is not being proposed or implemented to benefit the employee or customer.\n\nAnd now about that proven rapist Trump thing:\n\n*(trigger warning: the following court decisions contain extremely graphic and blunt descriptions of rape)*\n\n\"Consequently, the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused - indeed, raped - Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established and is binding in this case.\" See page 13 of the Judge's decision ...\u00a0[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf)\n\nMore questions about Donald J.

        "Text": "Muslims in Michigan began seeing pro-Israel ads this fall praising Vice President Kamala Harris for marrying a Jewish man and backing the Jewish state. Jews in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, saw ads from the same group with the opposite message: Harris wanted to stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel.Another group promoted \u201cKamala\u2019s bold progressive agenda\u201d to conservative-leaning Donald Trump voters, while a third filled the phones of young liberals with videos about how Harris had abandoned the progressive dream. Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches.What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the group\u2019s efforts obtained by The Washington Post.The project, funded with anonymous donations, micro-targeted messages across the battleground states, often with ads that appeared to be something they were not \u2014 a tactic the organizers sometimes referred to internally as \u201cfalse positives.\u201dWith digital spots, direct mail, text messages, influencer marketing and mobile billboards, the overall project was a high-tech experiment in misdirection \u2014 an old political tactic that has been sharpened in recent decades with increasingly precise targeting techniques.Ads tested better if Muslims felt they were seeing a message meant for Zionists, \u201cBernie bros\u201d felt they were hearing from the far left, and \u201cZyn bros\u201d felt they were hearing from activists who wanted \u201ca world without gas-powered vehicles,\u201d a ban on fracking and affordable housing for undocumented Americans \u2014 policies Harris did not actually support during her campaign.\u201cThe worst part is Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth,\u201d said one of the ads, which was designed by Trump supporters to look as if it was advocating for leftist priorities like \u201cfree health care\u201d and a \u201cbreak on tuition.\u201dElon Musk speaks at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in New York on Oct. 27. A group of Musk political advisers funded a $45 million misdirection campaign targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)The entire effort grew out of research by Building America\u2019s Future, a conservative political nonprofit that was founded during the first Trump administration by Republican consultants Generra Peck and Phil Cox. With others at P2 Public Affairs, Peck and Cox, former advisers to DeSantis, were top strategists for a separate effort, America PAC, the super PAC funded by Musk to support Trump. Musk donated to Building America\u2019s Future in 2022, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The group\u2019s leaders have declined to comment on their donors.Starting in February, Ryan Tyson, a former pollster for DeSantis, began holding a series of about 25 focus groups with specific communities of targeted voters, with most of the research effort focused on likely Democrats who were uncertain about voting. The goal was to figure out how to help Donald Trump win during a campaign in which Democrats were vastly outspending Republicans on digital advertising\u2026\u2026.",

There will be a recession and possibly depression, there will be more people having to take the jobs the immigrant community used to do for less money than they received, the world will be a simple but no longer deeply embedded ally of America and Russian people will have gotten part of the Ukraine they don\u2019t deserve and the war will be mostly a mop up operation by Russia/Korean troops all the while the EU will have fortified and gotten much closer to China. The world will be changed and many people will feel it. But don\u2019t blame the Democrats for doing the best for low and middle income Americans over the past four years. The predecessor wanted people to inject bleach in their arms to cure COVID while sending testing kits to the President of Russia. Just fucking think about that a minute or two!",

Empiracally, provably.  \n\nAre the democrats for the working class?  Debatable, and I personally land on no.\n\nHere's the real problem.  Inflation is a natural part of our economy, and at strong points in our economy, wages go up at the same rate as inflation (not just the average wage, but the minimum wage and the median wage).  \n\nHowever, for the past **50 years**, income has not kept up with inflation.  The past 8 years just happened to be significatnly worse on that front, so we felt more pain in a shorter amount of time.\n\nThe democrats aren't proposing to make that right.  They are proposing to not make it so wrong.  They need to understand the difference.\n\nBecause when the republicans are promising \"vote for us, and you individually will have more money in your pocket\", which is technically true, the voters don't care about your breadcrumbs.",

He tells them what they want to hear (all lies and made up logic) and they give him the vote. Critical thinking has taken a back seat in this country.",

The founding fathers very explicitly did not trust the average person, because they thought they wouldn't be civically engaged and thus would be too easily led into mobs if the masses were given too much power.\n\nWhat's changed is how complicated society has become.\n\nLike I know fishermen that voted on a single issue:  off shore wind farms.\n\nHarris wants to build them, which would be disruptive to fishing.  Trump said he doesn't, but in reality he doesn't care.  \n\nYou can say that Trump lied, and that my fishermen friends just lack critical thinking ability, but to blame 80 million people for that I think is problematic.\n\nPeople will always vote for whatever is closest to them.  This is a problem in winner-take-all politics, because people ***have to*** vote with things they don't want to.  Like if someone is a single issue voter between capitalism and socialism, but they want things like equality in marriage or employment opportunity, they have to make a hard choice between the GOP and the Democrats.  And I would say that's a problem beyond Trump, because even without Trump, you're going to have people that vote for the GOP because of their economic beliefs, religious beliefs, or patriotic beliefs, despite not necessarily agreeing with everything on their platform, just because the GOP speaks more to the issues closest to them.\n\nYou say that shows a lack of critical thinking on behalf of the politic.\n\nFine.\n\nIf that's the case, then we really, ***really*** need to change our form of government to compartmentalized our politics away from this winner-take-all system, so that single issue voters can vote their concsious without doing what millions perceive as destroying the country.",

        "Text": "Bernie Sanders released a statement yesterday following the election results that could not have been more accurate. The Democrat party have completely turned their backs on working families.  As 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, the DNC, Biden, and Kamala have continuously said the economy said was strong and healthy.\n\n  \nInflation & the economy were top issues in this presidential cycle for independent voters, which indicates their displeasure for the current estate of affairs. If inflation was low and the economy were strong, it wouldn't have been an issue. This led to hundreds of thousands of voters to cast their vote for Donald Trump, who has swayed them with his hopes and promises.\n\nThe reality is, Trump will not make this economy stronger in 4 years, it will be WEAKER. Trump's tax cuts will create a bigger deficit in our budget, along with the continuation of foreign aid to Israel. Harris would not have made this economy stronger either. This current economy is not solely the blame of Biden, its been a continuation of wasteful military spending and other reckless spending beginning with George W. Bush, now being passed back to Trump. The US has been lucky to not have been in a complete recession since then, simply the can is being kicked down the road. And the continuation of bank bailouts and corporate leaders in bed with the government will only make us WEAKER.\n\n  \nIf you are are Trump supporter, you need to recognize that Trump cannot fix this economy with his current plan. He wants to cut interest rates,  lower taxes, and maintain government spending, this is QE and inflationary.\n\n  \nIf you are a Harris supporter, you need to recognize that in certain places of our country currently people pay more in taxes than they do Norway, Sweden, Finland etc. Why is it that we pay more in taxes and do not have free education, healthcare, homeless programs like our friends in Europe? Hint: It's the government's mismanagement of funds.\n\n  \nI don't predict the US will have a better economy in the foreseeable future, it will have to create a Great Depression for any change to occur, because their needs to be DRASTIC change.\n\n  \nWhether you are friends of the RNC or DNC, federal government spending and management is a total disaster. If we want to be like our friends in Europe, we need leave the Federal Government with responsibility of the military, and allow State & Local governments more power to assist the people in need of their jurisdiction. \n\n  \nGovernment programs such as Trump's PPP loans, FEMA, student loans are part of the problem. If we simply got rid of our federal government student loan programs, tuition would drastically be less, if our tax money went to state & local governments and people want free education in their state, they should be able to vote and keep their local politicians accountable.\n\nDC cannot possibly be knowledgeable for the needs of people in Hawaii, Alaska, or Florida, however the local governments who are on the ground are. The problem with the US is the Federal government's lousy job in thinking they know what's right for its people, and wasteful spending on things the people did not ask for.\n\n  \nSo if you voted for Trump or Harris, our economy will be much more worse in 4 years than it is now. The stock market sky rocketing because of a Trump win yesterday, tells me people still don't get it.\n\n\n\n ",

The entire \u201cthe world is ending\u201d routine we\u2019ve gotten both times trump has won is the equivalent for democrats and isn\u2019t endearing either.

I don\u2019t see him coming up with a serious or positive solution either, considering his last plan was the wall which didn\u2019t get very far. As far as rights go, you may have a point but I would be very surprised to see anything passed of a truly radical nature. The American populace has come to accept gay rights, trans rights aren\u2019t all that different. I think the main concern many have is in regard to children and the health ramifications of changing gender at a younger, immature age. Which is a fair concern in my mind and adds some nuance to the conversation, but I doubt results in the complete turn of denying all gender affirming care.

            "It\u2019s not very common to get thoughtful views from conservatives on Reddit, especially in tense times around elections. \n\nI\u2019ll try and fairly represent their perspective. \n\nDonald Trump transformed the political landscape in 2016. He disrupted the \u201cestablishment\u201d figures in each party (Bush, Clinton). It\u2019s important to keep this in mind to understand how he is always seen as an \u201coutsider\u201d or \u201cdisrupter\u201d of established political order\u2026. even when he was president of the United States. \n\nDemocrats faced a similar populist backlash to republicans in 2016 - seen with Bernie Sanders. Yet, the Democratic Party repudiated this viewpoint to a certain extent, when republicans endorsed it wholeheartedly. This gives the impression, real or not, that democrats represent the party of continuity, whereas republicans are the party of change. \n\nEnter the present setting, Kamala did not undergo a traditional primary process. She received the nomination after a career politician, Joe Biden, stepped down and nominated her for the position. Kamala is inextricably linked to an unpopular president, his unpopular immigration policies, and a broader (and unpopular) establishment political order. \n\nThis largely defines how candidates are perceived on the right. While all of the above is true, there are different ways of framing and context that make it more or less appropriate seeming. \n\nIn terms of POLICY: there is also stark difference. Yet, when we discuss voters, we still need to focus on perception. Trump is seen as being more sensitive to blue collar and manufacturing jobs, going back to making promises to coal miners in 2016. Trump has long attacked globalization and the negative effects that it has had on U.S. manufacturing. \n\nAs someone that does NOT support Trump,  I feel the need to include that this voter perception is not accurate. He invested less in manufacturing job and new factory production than Biden when he was president. \n\nHappy to answer questions, hope this helps.",
            "If you're going to follow American politics, you need to familiarize yourself with how much racism is at the core of the politics and vote here. \n\nPeople will lie to themselves about what they think the candidates stand for just bc of the color of their skin. Union members, whose continued existence is solely due to \"radical\" leftists like Kamala are leaning towards Trump bc they think he's going to be better for their union, despite him continuously making anti-union comments and promises.",
            "This doesn't answer your question but I do want to mention the fatigue of \"left\" voters in America. Realistically, I don't think I've met more than a couple people who truly identify as a Democrat. I live in a very red state so obviously my perception is skewed as such:\n\nPeople who vote red vote red just to vote red. A recent population influx proved that. The only reason a bunch of people moved here was to be in a \"red\" state. \n\nThe other reason people vote red is because of hot button issues like abortion and weed. They don't have long, deep conversations about the ramifications of either outcome. They only talk about what is \"good\" or \"bad\". I asked my immigrant coworker who he voted for and he said, \"Trump, because I don't like killing babies.\" It is literally that simple for SO many American voters. One issue, and their decision is made. He even admitted he doesn't like Trump but that's what made him vote for him. This happens on both sides, I just tend to see it more with conservatives. \n\nOn the other hand, people who don't vote red aren't just voting blue to vote blue. They want change and hate the government as it is. They see all of the flaws and are tired of adhering to a system that allows little to no flexibility. We also for some reason still have the electoral college, which principally destroys the idea that America is a democracy. WE THE PEOPLE aren't shit and haven't been for a long time. We are a corporatocracy and voting blue isn't going to change that. Left voters know that and thus don't get on our knees and open our greedy little mouths to any dem who takes the stage.\n\nThe left is willing to criticize and make their own decisions where the right prescribes themselves to a side and adheres to it no matter what (Im generalizing the extremes, as they tend to be the most vocal). Either that or they decide on a single hot button issue. Politics here is a joke. \n\nI haven't heard a single genuine argument for either Harris or Trump. I've only heard that Harris is a cop and Trump is a felon. No one is vouching for who they believe in, just trying their hardest to make the other party look worse. \n\nMaybe this makes me extremist but until the American people get tired of corporations and dirty horrible geriatric alzheimic people running our country, nothing is going to change. We're either gonna have a violent outbreak or total apathy. either way we are falling apart and I genuinely can't fucking wait. I just really hope \"dems\" don't do anything stupid once that fat orange criminal clown is given back his crown.",

        "Text": "With the U.S. election coming up, it\u2019s worth understanding the positions of each candidate on issues impacting Palestine. While both candidates have taken different stances, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump approach the Israel-Palestine conflict with noticeably different priorities.\n\nDonald Trump has consistently demonstrated strong support for Israel, especially through actions and statements since October. \n\n* [Recently, he proposed new policies that include barring entry to individuals from areas he considers \u201csecurity threats,\u201d **including Gaza**, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-vows-expand-travel-ban-gaza-rcna120711)\n* He [also announced intentions to send deportation officers to U.S. protests he deems \u201cpro-Hamas,](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/trumps-plan-quell-protests-deport-hamas-radicals-rcna166168)\u201d a term that\u2019s broad and could easily be applied to many forms of Palestine support.\n\n* In an interview with Fox News, Trump said, \u201c[We need to protect Israel. There is no choice](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6338927770112),\u201d signaling a lack of openness to calls for de-escalation. \n\n* [The Trump Administration deviated from a 1978 State Department legal opinion that held Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are \u201cinconsistent with international law.\u201d](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-politics-west-bank-3da4fb3671004679a91a7d4ae9ab4e57\\))\n\n* [The Trump Administration cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees \\(UNRWA\\)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-administration-cuts-funding-united-nations-palestinian-refugee-agency-n905616\\))\n\n* He said \"[Actually, Israel is the one \\(that wants to keep going\\), and you should let them go and let them finish the job. He \\(Biden\\) doesn\u2019t want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian. He's a weak one.\u201d]\n(https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-criticized-palestinian-insult-debate-with-biden-2024-06-28/)\n\n* [He said : \"He\u2019s doing a good job,\u201d Trump said about the Israeli leader. \u201cBiden is trying to hold him back, just so you understand, Biden is more superior to the V.P. He\u2019s trying to hold him back, and he probably should be doing the opposite, actually. I\u2019m glad that \\[Netanyahu\\] decided to do what he had to do, but it\u2019s moving along pretty good\"](https://newrepublic.com/post/187332/trump-biden-tough-netanyahu)\n\n* He has continued to highlight his past actions, like [moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights) and [recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights). \n\n* [Trump told Netanyahu to \"Do what you have to do\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/trump-netanyahu-support-gaza-lebanon/)\n\n* [Trump stated that the U.S. should let the conflict \u201cplay out.\u201d\n](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4304401-trump-israel-hamas-war-let-things-play-out/)\n\n**His policies underline his clear alignment with Israeli interests.**\n\n\nKamala Harris, who is now leading the Democratic ticket after Biden stepped down, has taken a different approach. \n\n* [ She has called for peace and an immediate ceasefire, emphasizing protection and dignity for Palestinians, and added that \"what has happened in Gaza in the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking\"](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc).\n\n* [She was against the Israeli invasion of Rafah](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-rafah-gaza-tiktok.html\\))  \n\n* While she hasn\u2019t suggested specific policies like defunding Israel, she has spoken more[ broadly and extensively about the need for de-escalation and security for civilians in the region](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1234822836/kamala-harris-benny-gantz-gaza-cease-fire-israel-hamas).\n\nAs the campaign progresses, **Harris may be limited by the demands of a close race, but her emphasis on dialogue and restraint stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s** more unilateral support for Israel. For those watching the U.S. election with Palestine in mind, these are key points to consider.\n\nAs the race is expected to be close, with Trump leading in many polls, **keep in mind that a vote for a third-party candidate would likely have the effect of boosting Trump's chances.**\n\n**Much of this information and more straight facts on the candidates positions on Israel/Gaza can be found on [this page created by the Arab American Institute](https://www.aaiusa.org/president-issues/kamala-harris-on-palestine)**",

From an outsiders perspective it looks like Kamala is being smart - focusing on domestic policy. Once they are in office they can then be harder on Israel as they don't have to worry about backlash from the pro-israel part of the population at the polls.\nDespite this some are going to vote against her because of the Palestine issue. But from what we have heard Trump would be worse for Palestine? I get they want more done on the issue, but this seems like a bad tactic.\n\nSorry for the confusion, it just seems self sabotaging if they actually want to help Palestine. Are we missing some America specific context that would make this opposition to Kamala make more sense?",

Netanyahu, Likud (Netanyahu's far-right political party), and IDF leaders prefer Trump.\n\nSo a depressingly large chunk of the left has decided to advocate for the electoral outcome that includes Trump winning.

But it's a bit late to start doing that now and they'll really need people with more cultural influence than old athletes that young men today barely even know except by name.\n\nIt could also backfire a bit since so many athletes are more conservative despite the much higher proportion of African-Americans than in the general population.

Us as women know this, even if it\u2019s subconscious. This is why women hold more high education in America than men, but still make less. Continually having to amplify our resume just to get in the door.\nCurrently, we\u2019re witnessing this under a microscope in front of all America. Kamala Harris is CLEARLY the most qualified looking at just resumes, not even just moral character or personality; however, Americans (mostly men) have already made their own personal belief to discount her, and continue to try and knit pick her resume as an excuse to discredit her worthiness, even though Trump does not show ANY signs of a resume better.\n\nLooking at policy alone, originally the excuse was \u201cshe doesn\u2019t even have any policy,\u201d within her first 60 days of becoming the primary candidate.. then she posted policies, along with how they will get done, and how they will be paid, and now we\u2019re on to the next excuse.\n\nAt the end of the day, all of their excuses keep getting debunked, forcing them to move onto the next, revealing their true reasoning why.\n\nThis is a magnifying glass on America. The glass on that magnifier is the glass ceiling. It needs to break.\n\nThere is no question on qualifications. Is Kamala was a man, this would be a landslide..\n\nAt the end of the day, the note I want to leave on is this election is not about me vs. you, it\u2019s about the American people educating themselves so they don\u2019t vote against their own interests.\nRead the facts, and don\u2019t deny the facts just because they don\u2019t fit the narrative you want to be true.

You can't make this stuff up.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526)\n\nWhat Nick said in the tweet was this amongst other supporters being enraged.\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/)\n\n[https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html](https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html)\n\n**Here is Nick's quote.**\n\n>\"So, why did we do Stop the Steal? Why did anyone go to Jan. 6? Why did any one go to jail? ... It would have been good to know that before 1,600 people got charged,\" Fuentes said\u00a0**on his podcast**, referring to the criminal charges for those who invaded and ransacked the Capitol. \"It would\u2019ve been good to know that before I had all my money frozen, put on a no-fly list, banned from everything, lost all my bank and payment processing.\u201d\n\nNow, besides Nick being a white supremacist amongst other things I have to agree with the sentiment. It's pretty reasonable regardless of who it came from.\n\nThe weird part is what nobody was talking about in relation to the Harris / Trump debate. When ABC moderators asked Trump if he lost the election Trump went completely against the Lex Fridman interview and effectively retracted that he ever admitted to losing. I guess people were too busy laughing it up regarding Trump's gaffe regarding immigrants eating dogs and cats.\n\nTo me, this is a distraction to what is literally happening before our eyes. White supremacists are using Trump to start a civil war; AND, Trump is going right along with it.\n\nIf someone told Trump that he better follow along then there is no clearer example of the 72 hours or so that Trump went to admitting to a complete retraction. What's more odd is how fast Trump reversed and climbed right back into the racist and the worst of us political base.\n\nIt's as if Trump was willing to be \"more normal\" candidate when he was clearly in the winning category of the upcoming election. However, when it was becoming clear he was losing it's as if every guardrail has come off. He has fully surrounded himself with an absolute horrible person in Laura Loomer. She has gone so far as to not only suggest immigrants are eating pets via cats and dogs but also humans.\n\nMoreover, there has been bomb threats and now a deployment of Proud Boys descending on SpringField Ohio for the purpose of? WTF knows.\n\nWith all of this obviousness being thrown directly into our faces the Media is literally standing there and acting like everything is normal. It is so crazy, it is as if Trump is willing and ready to start January 6th again but right now. I don't even know if we will make it to the the election before something \"bad\" happens.\n\nAt what point is the media and Republican donors going to pull the rug and say this is absolutely not acceptable? Why is the media literally acting like this is even remotely normal.\n\nMy god, are we going to even make it to the election? I don't actually know at this point.",

As a consequence, children's schools had to be closed as did hospitals. The KKK has arrived too, as criminal opportunists. This woman's lie has set an entire town on fire figuratively.

            "These are cherry picked and 5 out of six are true, one had the defense of \"well Trump said he wouldnt\" as the reason for it being false. \n\n\nNot really good faith reporting if we are being honest here.",
            "Reported as misinformation, not in good faith.",
            "Yeah, there are a tone of disingenuous claims in this article. You can couch it in \"fact checking\" all you want, but the editorializing that the author adds completely undermines any legitimacy to their claims of bipartisanship.\u00a0\n\n\nBBC should be ashamed to print such drivel.",
            "1) Trump said he would not cut Social Security and Medicare - I don't doubt this is true on a personal level because he has enough political sensibilities to realize that George W. Bush got fucked on the same promises circa 2005 with an enormous swing towards Democrats in 2006, but let's not forget that Trump waffles all over the place, saying in 2016 he was fine with Obergefell but later remarking he might put judges in to reverse it\n\n2) Inflation - yes, inflation is down and has been higher than when Trump was in office, but a large part of the inflation problem is global, pent up-demand, and that's something neither Trump nor Kamala can really do anything about short of price controls, which Trump has denounced as \"communism\" (full disclosure: as a neoliberal, I am opposed to price controls)\n\n3) Jobs - correct. But I would be remiss to not mention that Trump's job growth itself was a continuation of the Obama era even when it was high. \n\n4) Economy - Trump did not drive the economy into the ground. It turns out that economies are very complex things indeed. I do not think his idea to put tarriffs on everything is great policy, however. We've seen how that tends to fuck economies in similar ways to price controls.\n\n5) Immigration - Trump was surely against it but didn't tank it. Right-wing Republicans have been tanking immigration deals since the pre-Trump era. It doesn't matter as much as we'd like to think. \n\n6) Abortion - Without Trump's justices, abortion could not have been banned in half the states in America. He is responsible in that regard. \n\nI am a liberal Democrat but I will be fair to Trump where he deserves it. In many of these cases, he does, but in as many, he does not.",

He is so upset about losing Biden as his opponent that he's even taken to posting freaky fan-fic on his Truth Social Platform, hopefully suggesting that Biden is going to storm the convention and take back the nomination:\n\n>Some of that is a classic \"I know you are but what am I\" Trump set up to rationalize a loss in November. He's going to say the Democrats staged a coup and usurped the Constitution by replacing Joe Biden on the ballot. It's laughably absurd but it will soothe him to say it and give his followers something to hang on to. But it's also obvious that he just can't wrap his mind around the fact that he has to run against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. It's so confusing to him that he can't even leave Mar-a-Lago anymore.

She can not properly defend her own positions on anything, and refuses to elaborate she plans on doing. It's a lot like what Nancy Pelosi said way back with \"we need to pass the bill to tell you what's in it.\" It's that, but for an entire Presidential campaign instead.\n\nWe've been funding the Ukraine-Russia year by proxy for over the past two years, with no offramp. We've been funding the first formally declared Israeli-Palestine war since the 1970s for the past ten months, with no offramp. These conflicts never emerged under the prior administration, because every decision Biden makes on foreign policy has been awful.\n\nKamala Harris would be no better, because she had to sign off on every awful decision Biden made. And she leans even further to the Left than he does, so her decisions would likely be even worse in comparison. Kamala suffers from the same sort of mentality that Hillary Clinton had in regards to being the first potential female President. She wants to act 'how the boys do', or at least how she perceives male politicians to be. Kamala wants to throw her weight around via the military, much like Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Biden all have done prior.\n\nThe problem is that this sort of approach has always led to military involvement from the United States on a direct or proxy level. Warhawk Tuah will likely involve us in a new conflict within her hypothetical first or second year in office. There's no way things don't get worse under her, given her past record. We've already seen the results of her being the Vice President. I'm genuinely worried she'd actually get us all killed through her sheer incompetence and sense of entitlement alone.",

            "It's funny how you deflected every single thing about Kamala and made it all about Trump, because you can't actually provide Amy answers about her.\n\nPresident Trump can lower inflation by simply reducing the amount of money spent on worthless proxy wars, such as Ukraine, for example. Another prime example would be removing Bidenomics entirely. The Inflation Reduction Act didn't reduce inflation.\n\nPresident Trump can help Americans achieve better Healthcare status by actually making the American people the priority. Illegal immigrants shouldn't be receiving free Healthcare, for example. No one should, for that matter. Healthcare is a commodity, to be bought and sold as such.\n\nPresident Trump's border wall project was obstructed throughout his entire term by Democrats. Kamala is now pretending to be a borderhawk after Biden stripped our border down to nothing for the past four years. Stricter methods will have to be enforced to curtail illegal aliens.\n\nAgain, President Trump's position on Healthcare is to minimize it's usage specifically to American citizens. And even then, it shouldn't be free.\n\nYou wrote the same thing twice here during your unhinged rant, so I'll skip this one.\n\nThe first formally declared Israeli-Palestine war since the 1970s, which started under Biden last year in October, is an unfortunate effect of his foreign policy weaknesses, such as repeatedly attempting to placate to the Iranians. Israel has had a vice grip over American politics for decades. It's unfortunate but sadly true. The best thing President Trump can do to deter Iran is allow Israel to properly fight it's own war instead of constantly trying to shame them, like the Biden Administration has doing.\n\nPresident Trump never called military veterans suckers and losers. This is about as old a lie as 'the fine people' myth, which Democrats have been prattling about for years, despite it being debunked by Snopes in 2020, while being repeatedly fact checked on it.\n\nPresident Trump never said that either. Pretty sure Iran hates Trump after he killed their general, Soleimani.\n\nPresident Trump never said that either. Trading someone like Britney Griner for a man named THE MERCHANT OF DEATH, was the mistake.\n\nPresident Trump was remarking on how Ghislaine Maxwell's boyfriend was murdered in prison. He specifically commented on how they needed to prove someone was guilty.\n\nWe are currently in a recession at the moment. Joe Biden's economy is terrible. This is why Kamala Harris is running on 'fixing the economy', despite trying to gaslight Americans that the economy is somehow doing well simultaneously. President Trump wasn't wrong about Bidenomics.\n\nThere is nothing illegal about imploring someone to not sign a peace deal. If that was the case, I'd imagine you'd have harsh words for Boris Johnson, who convinced Zelensky to not accept Russia's peace deal early on in the war. And consistent that the Palestinian people voted Hamas into power in the 2000s, President Trump wasn't wrong in his assessment that Israel needs to be allowed to handle the war on their own terms.\n\nPresident Trump has read from a teleprompter, but he's proven repeatedly he can speak without one. Kamala Harris, has not. Not to mention she hasn't held one press conference in the past near 40 days. And the only confirmed interview we know about so far will have Tim Walz present, in which he will shield her from any actual questions about her policies.\n\nFurthermore, your notion that President Trump wasn't shot is absolutely disgusting. There's literal frame by frame pictures of the bullet going past him. A man in the audience was killed protecting his family from the bullets, for fucks sake. And the shooter himself registered Republican to vote against Trump in the primaries. He voted to ActBlue, a Biden Super Pac fundraiser, in 2021.\n\nPeople such as yourself have questioned Trump's physical health since about 2017, while lying for years on end that Joe Biden wasn't in a state of serious mental decline for the past four years. Pardon me if I take such claims of Trump suffering from a case of lethal cardiac arrest with a grain of salt.\n\nThere. I have answered every single question about President Trump you had. You probably won't like any of those answers, but they are actual answers. I could've flipped like you did, and responded to every question with something about Kamala, but I didn't. Namingly because I'm still waiting for you to answer my questions about her. Like Kamala however, I doubt you'll actually answer any questions.\n\nTrump is placed behind bulletproof glass, because he's the first President to survive an assassination attempt since Ronald Reagan. Meanwhile, Kamala's bulletproof glass is provided as a cone of silence so as not to answer any questions on domestic or foreign policy. I don't think we're going to avoid any international incidents under Kamala through this supposed 'joy' that she has. \"Good vibes\" deterrence serves, not.",

            "Biden is the one with dementia. The Democrats lied about their incumbent's mental state for years, and then dropped him off a cliff when it became too obvious to the public. You're projecting pretty hard right now.\n\nThe economy under Biden is awful. We're currently suffering through inflation worst than the Jimmy Carter Era. The border was stifled due to the Democrats, and now Kamala is pretending she wants a strong border after allowing 15 million illegal aliens to enter the country.\n\nYour grammar is atrocious. Why would I want to say racial slurs? I'm not racist.\n\nYes, Trump was shot. I know this is a very hard pill for you to swallow. You can't go on for years about how not accepting reality is bad, and then openly proclaim that the first attempted assassination of a President since Ronald Reagan was fake. \n\nYou're literally just repeating the same talking points, complete with emoji. I'm starting to believe you're mentally ill. I've heard all of this nonsense about Trump before. About how he's going down, the walls are closing in, it's the beginning of the end, etc etc. And it never happens. I've heard that the man is one hamburger away from a heart attack, but that never happens either.\n\nI reiterate. Trump is behind bulletproof glass, so he doesn't get shot. Kamala is behind bulletproof glass, so she doesn't have to answer questions. And like Kamala, you don't want to answer questions either. It's all about childish deflection and insults. You're a literal danger to the country, and perhaps the world, through your ineptitude and sense of entitlement alone."

            ">\u201cThis is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,\u201d Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and onetime Trump administration official, told Politico. \u201cThis is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semiconscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we\u2019re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.\u201d As a reminder, last week Trump appeared before the National Association of Black Journalists and told members that the VP, who attended a historically Black college, was only Indian until a few years ago. He presumably thought this would help him with Black voters, but it only demonstrated what many people have long known: that he\u2019s not very bright and doesn\u2019t know how race works.\n\n>All of this is leaving Republicans hoping that the ex-president will realize the error of his ways and get his shit together. And considering that would effectively require him to receive a personality transplant overnight, not everyone is convinced it\u2019s possible.",
            "He's starting to sound \"mental\".",
            "Romney is far right of center and Trump calls him a RINO.\n\nTrump wants to go far enough to the right to take us into Fascism.",
            "Good",
            "\"Starting to\"",
            "old news",
            "But accurate news.",
            "perhaps not relevant to the OP?",
            "Well, in my opinion, Trump may have had a chance if his position was not so insanely hard right.\n\nTrump and MAGA call anyone right of center radical leftists unless they are at the extreme far end of the spectrum.\n\nNow, I think he is figuring out that he overplayed his hand and that MAGA way way way, overplayed his hand to the point where MAGA destroyed Trump's Chances and I think somehow, that understanding, has seeped into his brain now.",
            "you\u2019re giving him way too much credit. his position is simply whatever gives him the most attention and power. he doesnt give a shit about anyone or anything else. he admires violent dictators because he thinks they had/have unlimited power and attention. he doesnt think about how mussolini and hitler ended up.",
            "Maybe.\n\nI think he represents a fairly serious danger to America.\n\nDo I think he will win the votes? Not a chance but he can not be trusted.",
            "i dont think it\u2019s HIM that is the worst danger\u2026 yes he is dangerous. but i think the people who are supporting him present a clear and present danger to US democracy. dictators and wanna be dictators exist all over the world, but the people who support them are the ones who will overturn democracy if given the real chance. \n\ni think the US will follow the UK and france in beating back the fascists. but this will not eliminate the danger. we have a long way to go to overcome that.",
            "When I refereed to Fascism, I was referring to the money people who would be controlling the lawmakers.\n\nTrump has not a civic bone in his body. His mission in taking the presidency, was to help the money interests, his interests, and he knew enough to get the big money to back him.\n\nIf he wins this time, they win. If he loses this time, they have to sit and wait again for the right candidate, left or right, to come along.\n\nI not only think we are in end stage capitalism, I think it will be combined with severe economic collapse partly because of global warming. We will be ripe for Fascism.\n\nThe big food corporations are buying up the empty sky scrapers and turning them into vertical gardens. I suspect, they see major crop losses in the future. It just is not economical to grow indoors at scale. It is very economical if it is the best or only game in town.\n\nI also see the ultra rich buying up old mines and turning them into self contained living space with independent water and electric supply, indoor grow spaces, and living quarters for the select few and the workers.\n\nOf course, they can just be doing is for a host of reasons but I suspect they see global warming as a major issue.\n\nThis ball we call earth is about 1,800 miles in diameter. That is a lot of mass and we have been heating it now for a couple of hundred years. I will bet the results of our efforts lag the input by 20 to 50 years. So when we stop burning oil, the place will continue to heat up for a good long while.\n\nI also doubt we will stop until we actually feel the pain.\n\nAny or all of those possibilities would change our politics into something we would not recognize today.\n\nI am now 73 so for me, it is more about just watching it and trying to make it better where I can.\n\nIn 2012, I stopped all row crops on this 40 acre farm and began planting wildflowers and trees. Nature helps with the soft woods, Cotton woods, Maples, Ems and bushes. Maybe 100,000 trees or so and I have planted several thousand assorted nuts, acorns, walnuts, hickory nuts and such. Those first trees are now like 10 feet tall.\n\nWe have a lake here set in the middle towards the back. 6 acres  in size, 22 feet deep, and well stocked with fish that we own. At any given moment, there are around 20 tons of living fish in there. If I can get this farm shaded over by roughly 2034 or so, I can keep the summertime temperature here, 20 degrees cooler than in town on a hot summer day. If I succeed, I may be adding 20 to 50 years to that body of water. That is roughly half a trillion gallons.\n\nThis started out as merely an idea to make a safe zone for nature here. We've now gained roughly 35 deer and 75 turkeys that live here full time now. I soon enough realized it might be our safe zone as well.\n\nThen because I've known what a shit bag he was since the 70's, I go against him at every chance."

        "Text": "Muslims in Michigan began seeing pro-Israel ads this fall praising Vice President Kamala Harris for marrying a Jewish man and backing the Jewish state. Jews in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, saw ads from the same group with the opposite message: Harris wanted to stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel.Another group promoted \u201cKamala\u2019s bold progressive agenda\u201d to conservative-leaning Donald Trump voters, while a third filled the phones of young liberals with videos about how Harris had abandoned the progressive dream. Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches.What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the group\u2019s efforts obtained by The Washington Post.The project, funded with anonymous donations, micro-targeted messages across the battleground states, often with ads that appeared to be something they were not \u2014 a tactic the organizers sometimes referred to internally as \u201cfalse positives.\u201dWith digital spots, direct mail, text messages, influencer marketing and mobile billboards, the overall project was a high-tech experiment in misdirection \u2014 an old political tactic that has been sharpened in recent decades with increasingly precise targeting techniques.Ads tested better if Muslims felt they were seeing a message meant for Zionists, \u201cBernie bros\u201d felt they were hearing from the far left, and \u201cZyn bros\u201d felt they were hearing from activists who wanted \u201ca world without gas-powered vehicles,\u201d a ban on fracking and affordable housing for undocumented Americans \u2014 policies Harris did not actually support during her campaign.\u201cThe worst part is Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth,\u201d said one of the ads, which was designed by Trump supporters to look as if it was advocating for leftist priorities like \u201cfree health care\u201d and a \u201cbreak on tuition.\u201dElon Musk speaks at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in New York on Oct. 27. A group of Musk political advisers funded a $45 million misdirection campaign targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)The entire effort grew out of research by Building America\u2019s Future, a conservative political nonprofit that was founded during the first Trump administration by Republican consultants Generra Peck and Phil Cox. With others at P2 Public Affairs, Peck and Cox, former advisers to DeSantis, were top strategists for a separate effort, America PAC, the super PAC funded by Musk to support Trump. Musk donated to Building America\u2019s Future in 2022, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The group\u2019s leaders have declined to comment on their donors.Starting in February, Ryan Tyson, a former pollster for DeSantis, began holding a series of about 25 focus groups with specific communities of targeted voters, with most of the research effort focused on likely Democrats who were uncertain about voting. The goal was to figure out how to help Donald Trump win during a campaign in which Democrats were vastly outspending Republicans on digital advertising\u2026\u2026.",

So I broke down Trump voters into 3 types of people. If you voted for him let me know what type you are. \n\n1. This is what I call \u201cTrump fans\u201d. These are the people who are buying MAGA hats, yard signs, etc. They are very excited to have him as president and there are very few people, if anyone that they would prefer as president. These people like him as a person and like his policies. \n2. People in this group don\u2019t like Trump as a person. They criticize him for some of the things he\u2019s done in his personal life. Maybe these people would\u2019ve preferred a different Republican like DeSantis or Nikki Haley  thinking they would be a better fit. However, they went with Trump because they like his policies. \n3. People in this group dislike his policies and dislike him as a person. However, they also dislike Harris\u2019s policies and/or her as a person. Therefore they had to pick the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d and decided that that was Trump.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1grax1i)",

Ass kissing our enemies, and fighting hardest for fringe issues... pushing identity politics over all else.\n\nThere are people who want to be proud to be American, and proud of America. Who prefer a traditional state of things vs the craziness we've seen. Pretending that girls are boys and boys are girls.... and being viciously attacked if we don't play along.  Not that we care what you do in your own time... but it doesn't have to be the focus of our life too.",

            "I was more trying to see whether his supporters had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him. I guess when I think of a Trump supporter I think of \u201cTrump fans\u201d. I know some people voted for him because they think he\u2019ll fix the economy and prefer tradition in terms of social issues. I wanted to know whether they are just conservative and prefer his policies to Harris but don\u2019t like him or if they actually like who he is as a person",

On top of that, the current administration is pissing on people's legs and telling them that it's raining.... when they tell them how strong and great the economy is while people can barely afford food.\n\nTrump was president for 4 years once and things were good, and none of the horrible claims, from the left came true.",
            "Look I\u2019m not here for a debate. You are very unlikely to change my mind and I assume the same vice versa. I think your line of thinking is incorrect but I\u2019m not gonna waste my breath explaining that. I was simply trying to find out whether people who voted for him think that Donald Trump voted for him because they think he\u2019s a good person or despite the fact that he is not. I don\u2019t appreciate you making  assumptions about me either. Like I said I understand that you think he\u2019s going to help the economy.

Harris never found her audience that she needed to get elected and thus she never provided any clear vision or goals to reach that vision.\n\nYes, the GOP and their rapist boss Trump lied all over the place and pushed a truly vile, violent, racist, bigoted, authoritarian agenda - but they their lies created the illusion of a vision and goals. The rapist regularly discussed how dark and horrible everything would be if \"he\", the rapist, weren't elected as our President; and \"he\" regularly discussed how bright and beautiful everything will be with him, the rapist, in office.\n\nThe vision was bullshit, the goals are not going to do what most people think ... but it didn't matter. The candidate who thought rape is fine got elected, and the candidate who put rapists in jail lost - because of a lack of vision and goals."

There will be a recession and possibly depression, there will be more people having to take the jobs the immigrant community used to do for less money than they received, the world will be a simple but no longer deeply embedded ally of America and Russian people will have gotten part of the Ukraine they don\u2019t deserve and the war will be mostly a mop up operation by Russia/Korean troops all the while the EU will have fortified and gotten much closer to China. The world will be changed and many people will feel it. But don\u2019t blame the Democrats for doing the best for low and middle income Americans over the past four years. The predecessor wanted people to inject bleach in their arms to cure COVID while sending testing kits to the President of Russia. Just fucking think about that a minute or two!",

Empiracally, provably.  \n\nAre the democrats for the working class?  Debatable, and I personally land on no.\n\nHere's the real problem.  Inflation is a natural part of our economy, and at strong points in our economy, wages go up at the same rate as inflation (not just the average wage, but the minimum wage and the median wage).  \n\nHowever, for the past **50 years**, income has not kept up with inflation.  The past 8 years just happened to be significatnly worse on that front, so we felt more pain in a shorter amount of time.\n\nThe democrats aren't proposing to make that right.  They are proposing to not make it so wrong.  They need to understand the difference.\n\nBecause when the republicans are promising \"vote for us, and you individually will have more money in your pocket\", which is technically true, the voters don't care about your breadcrumbs.",

Trump said he doesn't, but in reality he doesn't care.  \n\nYou can say that Trump lied, and that my fishermen friends just lack critical thinking ability, but to blame 80 million people for that I think is problematic.\n\nPeople will always vote for whatever is closest to them.  This is a problem in winner-take-all politics, because people ***have to*** vote with things they don't want to.  Like if someone is a single issue voter between capitalism and socialism, but they want things like equality in marriage or employment opportunity, they have to make a hard choice between the GOP and the Democrats.  And I would say that's a problem beyond Trump, because even without Trump, you're going to have people that vote for the GOP because of their economic beliefs, religious beliefs, or patriotic beliefs, despite not necessarily agreeing with everything on their platform, just because the GOP speaks more to the issues closest to them.\n\nYou say that shows a lack of critical thinking on behalf of the politic.\n\nFine.\n\nIf that's the case, then we really, ***really*** need to change our form of government to compartmentalized our politics away from this winner-take-all system, so that single issue voters can vote their concsious without doing what millions perceive as destroying the country.",

        "Text": "Bernie Sanders released a statement yesterday following the election results that could not have been more accurate. The Democrat party have completely turned their backs on working families.  As 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, the DNC, Biden, and Kamala have continuously said the economy said was strong and healthy.\n\n  \nInflation & the economy were top issues in this presidential cycle for independent voters, which indicates their displeasure for the current estate of affairs. If inflation was low and the economy were strong, it wouldn't have been an issue. This led to hundreds of thousands of voters to cast their vote for Donald Trump, who has swayed them with his hopes and promises.\n\nThe reality is, Trump will not make this economy stronger in 4 years, it will be WEAKER. Trump's tax cuts will create a bigger deficit in our budget, along with the continuation of foreign aid to Israel. Harris would not have made this economy stronger either. This current economy is not solely the blame of Biden, its been a continuation of wasteful military spending and other reckless spending beginning with George W. Bush, now being passed back to Trump. The US has been lucky to not have been in a complete recession since then, simply the can is being kicked down the road. And the continuation of bank bailouts and corporate leaders in bed with the government will only make us WEAKER.\n\n  \nIf you are are Trump supporter, you need to recognize that Trump cannot fix this economy with his current plan. He wants to cut interest rates,  lower taxes, and maintain government spending, this is QE and inflationary.\n\n  \nIf you are a Harris supporter, you need to recognize that in certain places of our country currently people pay more in taxes than they do Norway, Sweden, Finland etc. Why is it that we pay more in taxes and do not have free education, healthcare, homeless programs like our friends in Europe? Hint: It's the government's mismanagement of funds.\n\n  \nI don't predict the US will have a better economy in the foreseeable future, it will have to create a Great Depression for any change to occur, because their needs to be DRASTIC change.\n\n  \nWhether you are friends of the RNC or DNC, federal government spending and management is a total disaster. If we want to be like our friends in Europe, we need leave the Federal Government with responsibility of the military, and allow State & Local governments more power to assist the people in need of their jurisdiction. \n\n  \nGovernment programs such as Trump's PPP loans, FEMA, student loans are part of the problem. If we simply got rid of our federal government student loan programs, tuition would drastically be less, if our tax money went to state & local governments and people want free education in their state, they should be able to vote and keep their local politicians accountable.\n\nDC cannot possibly be knowledgeable for the needs of people in Hawaii, Alaska, or Florida, however the local governments who are on the ground are. The problem with the US is the Federal government's lousy job in thinking they know what's right for its people, and wasteful spending on things the people did not ask for.\n\n  \nSo if you voted for Trump or Harris, our economy will be much more worse in 4 years than it is now. The stock market sky rocketing because of a Trump win yesterday, tells me people still don't get it.\n\n\n\n ",

They're afraid of sounding radical. They absolutely lack any leadership at this point.\n\nLeadership is the relationship between a leader and a group in pursuit of a common goal. \n\nWhen President Biden was running for office, he talked about huge programs to jump start the economy coming out of Covid and building an infrastructure for the future that didn't include fossil fuels. President Biden won.\n\nHarris went back to the standard playbook of \"can't we just be friends and polite?\" And Harris' job ends in a couple months.

Saying they\u2019re paranoid, deranged, doomsayers, or uninformed.\n\nIdk who needs to hear this but, PROJECT 25 IS REAL AND IT IS HAPPENING. It\u2019s not a story made up by the media, Kamala Harris, or anyone else. The heritage foundation has every intention of implementing it and so does Mr. 47th president. Their agenda is to create an ultra conservative theocracy/autocracy, and there is literally no evidence that this is an exaggeration. \n\nLook it up, its 100% real, not a paranoid overreaction, not fear-mongering. The irony is it will affect the people who voted for him. Criminalizing porn\u2026seriously? Pretty sure his voters watch just as much porn as anyone else, I mean the guy fucked a porn star for christ sake. But if you try to explain this to a Trumper all you get is a smirk and a \u201cTHATS NOT EVEN REAL, you\u2019re a sore loser, cry baby, he\u2019s just fixing the economy you dummy\u201d ",

Meanwhile on the other side, we have people who are happy - not that they won, but that the other side *lost,* happy that *they're* upset, and *angry* that they dared expect anything else. They're not happy about their win - they're angry, *and* they won, which justifies and celebrates their anger.\n\nThe angry people have more to say.",

It could easily become a situation where Trump just does his rallies and signs paper put in front of him for cameras, but not make any decisions. Vance is 100% determined to get Project 2025. He's run with Donnie because he knows his chance of being President or having enough influence to make it happen is higher as VP to Trump than any other way. \n\nI will also point out during Trumps last term he implemented over 65% of their suggestions for that term. He knows he owes hard core, right wing evangelicals for his win.",

All they did was tell you they were going to do better at the same shit the Republicans were busy telling people they were going to do.

It is a horrid goal, but it provided the vision and the leadership opportunity for the proven rapist, business fraud, and serial liar Trump.\n\nThe problem for Harris is she never fully embraced clearly stated public vision of where she wanted to lead us, and thus she never developed clear, articulable goals. The general Democratic approach, including Harris', was to follow the standard Democratic billionaire$$ protecting, surrender monkey path by claiming to want to be a president for everyone and embracing with alacrity some of the very same people that helped bring on the GOP's contemporary vile agenda.\n\nOh well, this is where we are.

        "Text": "Once again, as in my first post, I will address the mythical government figures that were actually just fabrications. \n\nFirst of all, Barrack Obama. If you look into the inner depths of the US deep state (a phrase that I might remind the Fascist writers of Project 2025 appropriated to justify wanting to dissolve the department of education) you will find files detailing Czech President V\u00e1clav Klaus assassinating Obama on April 5th 2009. Hours after this, a body double was placed to hold a speech about nuclear weapons, to disguise the act.\n\nThis body double was brought back to the US, and assumed the role of President. Howevee, in late 2013, this body double would die of natural causes (just ask the staff of George Washington University Hospital). Unwilling to inform the public, advanced projection, deepfaking, and CGI technology was used to fabricate the next 3 years of the Obama presidency. To this day, the government occasionally brings out this Obama faker tech to major Democratic Party events such as this year's DNC. It shouldn't be surprising that it was current President Joe Biden who planned all of this, to disguise his secret takeover of power with a council of government officials, such as the secretary of state, treasurer, and speaker of the house (who used her and later his power in planning the house of representatives to unschedule and quell discussion about these facts).\n\nOnto another fabrication, this time being John McCain. It is amazing how far the US will go to conceal their actions. Now, John may be the most important. He was the first we know for sure. His faking set a precedent for the US to do similar actions, such as the previously mentioned Obamaspiracy. Now, John McCain might have actually been a real person. In one of my posts, I incorrectly stated there was no birth certificate, but since then I have done more digging, and God (calling me from a 1995 Nokia in Albania) has guided me. However, there is still a major gap in his life (1981-1987) that is preceded by strange circumstances in his home town just weeks before this gap of knowledge is thought to have started. Strange black vans and questions asked to the local populace. This gap started with John disappearing from the public eye and the death of his father (an assassination of an admiral orchestrated by the US government). Now it is unknown whether the actual John McCain was used as a puppet, being appointed a senator in 1987, or whether he was killed, his identity stolen, and used in the previously mentioned advanced technology, which the government has had since at least 1945, where they faked splitting an atom, an action physically impossible, to fake John's entire existence. Regardless, John McCain as we know him was a fabrication. He was not intended to win in 2008. There was serious ballot stuffing in Obama's favour, even with Obama still being the more popular candidate, to guarantee his already likely victory, since the government had no plans for John McCain to win.\n\nI'd like to quickly address another sidetrack from my first post. It doesn't matter who you vote for, but we can agree that Bill Clinton was a pathological liar. Not only did he target Hillary Clinton in a severe DA case that ended with her tragic death in the 90s, but then went on, hours later, to give his famous \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\" speech with a straight face. It's unnatural. There is no empathy for his actions in those eyes. Still in such recent memory as well for him. Horrific. Considering his radical centrist policies, I would not be suprised if he was also a fabrication, but this has just been hidden too well. Regardless, the government used a convenient figure they could dig up who they also knew everything about, Hillary, to easily fabricate an opposition to Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nA few people were suprised at my claim that Donald Trump was killed in 2019. In early February (I incorrectly stated May before, I'm still human), a group of Neo-Nazis kidnapped and killed Trump. Officially, their motive was Trump's rhetoric in the 2016 campaign being harsher than his actions, but unofficially, his presidency was a disaster. Do you think it's a coincidence that in early April, soon after the government took over, replacing the incompetent Trump, it was reported that \"Trump\" was on track to pass his deregulation goal by 31 times according to the Washington Examiner? \n\nNow after this, the chief Oligarch, none other than former Vice President Joe Biden decided it was time to stop operating from the shadows and directly take the reins of power. He ran against a \"Trump\" that everyone despised and won easily? He then orchestrated Jan 6th to defame their cause further and to make more people support him. Now, he wishes to return to the shadows after 1 term through appearing weak and stupid, then controlling both candidates in the next election. He made sure that none of them could ever become too powerful. Trump is (il)legally dead and his words are controlled by Joe, while Harris is a junior fire-fighter who has had no experience with politics, and was just picked up off the streets to become a puppet of the government. No matter who wins, this is just Biden's 4th term. All of this, again, to present the lie that the centre is working perfectly fine. Joe wishes to sap the power he can get from the collapsing democracy and escape, leaving the US to radical groups and violence. In a 2 party system, both parties become complacent eith always being elected, become indistinguishable, and once they start ignoring the common man, because they know they will always be the next elected, the common man turns to radical, hateful ideologies. Joe Biden is perhaps the only man who alone can fix this, but instead he wishes to lie about the 2 party system still controlling the majority of the nation, to slow the spread of these fringe ideological groups, rather than treat the US population like he cares and keep the parties alive.\n\nThe centre must hold. We must do anything in our power to stop this corrupt erosion of the natural order or politcal moderation, to free ourselves from the 2 parry binary and neuter parties and movements that seek only to kill and loot, including neo-nazis and hard-line communists.\n\nI hope you heed my warning, and thank you for listening.",

I\u2019m glad that \\[Netanyahu\\] decided to do what he had to do, but it\u2019s moving along pretty good\"](https://newrepublic.com/post/187332/trump-biden-tough-netanyahu)\n\n* He has continued to highlight his past actions, like [moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights) and [recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights). \n\n* [Trump told Netanyahu to \"Do what you have to do\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/trump-netanyahu-support-gaza-lebanon/)\n\n* [Trump stated that the U.S. should let the conflict \u201cplay out.\u201d\n](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4304401-trump-israel-hamas-war-let-things-play-out/)\n\n**His policies underline his clear alignment with Israeli interests.**\n\n\nKamala Harris, who is now leading the Democratic ticket after Biden stepped down, has taken a different approach. \n\n* [ She has called for peace and an immediate ceasefire, emphasizing protection and dignity for Palestinians, and added that \"what has happened in Gaza in the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking\"](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc).\n\n* [She was against the Israeli invasion of Rafah](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-rafah-gaza-tiktok.html\\))  \n\n* While she hasn\u2019t suggested specific policies like defunding Israel, she has spoken more[ broadly and extensively about the need for de-escalation and security for civilians in the region](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1234822836/kamala-harris-benny-gantz-gaza-cease-fire-israel-hamas).\n\nAs the campaign progresses, **Harris may be limited by the demands of a close race, but her emphasis on dialogue and restraint stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s** more unilateral support for Israel. For those watching the U.S. election with Palestine in mind, these are key points to consider.\n\nAs the race is expected to be close, with Trump leading in many polls, **keep in mind that a vote for a third-party candidate would likely have the effect of boosting Trump's chances.**\n\n**Much of this information and more straight facts on the candidates positions on Israel/Gaza can be found on [this page created by the Arab American Institute](https://www.aaiusa.org/president-issues/kamala-harris-on-palestine)**",

        "Title": "Polls vs. Anecdotal Evidence",
        "Text": "First - let me state. I'm not sure the polls were wrong in 2016. Going into that Sunday, my aggregation model had a very difficult path for Clinton.  In 2020, Biden was within the MoE of most polls.  The issue, of course was the Electoral College.\n\n  \nI am curious what am \\*I\\* missing or what are the pollsters missing this year.  First, I've thrown out all the GoP leaning polls AND polls where the results (e.g. one poll had Trump winning 28% of African American votes) or the sample was skewed. You end up focusing on YouGove, NYT, Maris, etc.  It still a stick 1-2 point race.  \n\nNow, I've taken stats classes but can't pretend I'm an expert. If ten polls all have MoE's of around 3%. Then if all the polls show someone leading between 1-3%, I would assume you can take some value in the consistency of these polls. Theoretically, if the MoE is 3% and the reality is a 3% lead, you'd end up with polls between +6 to 0. Right? All within the MoE.  So if all the polls are within 1-2 points. I figure there is some truth in the numbers.\n\nI can understand Trump is winning on an issues based campaign. He owns 3 of the top 4 issues. I tend to be a pessimist that Abortion will drive the day with things like the Economy and Immigration being the buzz of this election. I am concerned the Democrats are focusing too much on the Abortion message.  At some point, that issue isn't going to be the rallying cry.\n\nBut if this election is not an issues election, and I don't believe it is, I think the polls are very skewed. If you start with his ceiling at 48% (which I believe its 47%, but let's give it 48%).  She should be up at least 4. Now, all the polls, for the most part, show her within the MoE to get her that 4%. But I revert back to last question.\n\nI further don't believe in numbers as much as trends. And I am scratching my head on the trends - but Trump has closed strong the last two elections.\n\nI believe the following is true about this election:\n\n1. He has a ceiling of 48%\n\n2. The only new voters for Trump will be 18-21 year olds who grow up only knowing MAGA and some (I don't understand where they are) pro-MAGA that hasn't voted before\n\n3. Harris ground game is better\n\n4. She has more money\n\n5. Freedom/Democracy is on the ballot\n\n6. His temperament is suspect\n\n7. If you didn't vote for him before, you aren't voting for him now. To me, he's reached a peak of all potential voters (Registered or not) and he's only playing on the margins.\n\n8. She has run as good a campaign than anyone has ever run\n\n9. The coalition of the counter-party supporting the candidate has never been bigger or stronger\n\nSo what am I missing? Is my theory wrong and my arguments wrong? Are the polls right? Are both true and it is still this close? I don't bury my head and I don't shit the bed usually. But there is something either fundamentally wrong with the polls or, well, fundamentally wrong with the general arguments I laid out and shared with many.\n\nFor the record, early voting is no indication of future performance. If I vote early (which I haven't done before but will this election), I am taking away a vote on an Election Day.  We can't meet, but have to fully exceed 2020 and 2022 gap to believe there is any chance - and that assumes we are driving out more voters than in 2020 and 2022.\n\nOf course, the reality could be the polls are right. The general population is stupid and doesn't care about any of this and as such, is an issues election. That being the case, Trump winning would be appropriate and, based on how well she ran her campaign, this country is hopelessly lost.\n\nFor the record, I did not believe Biden was down as much in July as others thought because of the theory I set forth above. But I could be ignorant - but I wasn't in 2016. I truly didn't see a path for Clinton the Sunday before the election. I also tend to believe ever since the internet, polling is difficult for many reasons, including rapid news dissemination and fall of traditional contact means.  I think Nate Silver got lucky and has been riding that wave through all his misses. What I just can't wrap my head around is how the better pollster haven't learned enough to get better results. Maybe the outliers are the ones that figured it out?",

            "> The man who questioned Donald Trump\u2019s pet-eating lies during the Republican nominee\u2019s recent Univision town hall has now revealed he\u2019s voting for Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n>Jos\u00e9 Saralegui, a registered Republican, asked Trump this week if he truly believes his own false claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets.\n\n>\u201cThis was just reported. I was just saying what was reported, that\u2019s been reported, and eating other things, too, that they\u2019re not supposed to be,\u201d Trump responded at the Doral, Florida event.\n\n>\u201cBut this is... all I do is report. I have not... I was there, I\u2019m going to be there, and we\u2019re going to take a look, and I\u2019ll give you a full report when I do, but that\u2019s been in the newspapers and reported pretty broadly,\u201d he added.\n\nThey make up conspiracies. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling circle of conspiracies. They create the lie, pundits repeat the lie, they then turn around and claim, \u201cHey I\u2019m only saying what they\u2019re saying on the news.\u201d",

It was Democrat governments that invaded half the planet, killed Tortuguita, kept kids in cages, supplied bombs to Israel, undermined democracy in Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru, and left us without a decent public education system or universal healthcare.\n\nWhy do they assume I support their neoliberal, upper-middle-class interests? If you want Harris to win, convince the people who would benefit from her administration. But, oh right, those people are probably voting for Trump.

And both his Sec of Defense say that he's a threat to the US Constitution and a threat to the continued democracy of the United States.\n\nAnd yes, there won't be international wars if Donald Trump wins - because he'll roll over for the dictators of the world.  They are his friends.   He has said he'll use the US military against people in the United States, the 'enemy within.'\n\nTrump would have made friends with Hitler and the US would have been on the wrong side of history.

The upper middle class would rather align with billionaires than the actual working class because they aspire to join that elite group.\n\nAs an immigrant and working-class person of color, I can't relate to your ideals at all. Trying to scare me with Trump? That won't work. I despise him just as much as I despise Harris. Living under Trump wasn\u2019t worse for me than living under Biden. Our children are still in cages. We still have no healthcare, no education, no immigration reform, no labor protections. My taxes are being used to build COP-CITIES around the country, and murder children in Gaza and Lebanon and invade countries that have done nothing to us.\n\nIt\u2019s laughable that you think Trump would have befriended Hitler. The U.S. *was* friends with Hitler and European fascists\u2014until they couldn\u2019t be. And with some, like Franco, they remained allies, supporting his reign of terror until the '70s!\n\nBut that\u2019s the past. Today, Biden and Harris are best buddies with Netanyahu and fully support genocide. In fact, the actual fascist Italian Prime Minister Meloni has a better position toward genocidal Israel than the U.S. does. The U.S. is on the wrong side of history, *right now*.\n\nI see no difference between Trump and Biden.

However, recent polling data are very concerning - particularly one from today showing that Wisconsin, which had been leaning toward Harris, has now flipped to Trump. While I don\u2019t put much stock in polls, a swing like this so close to the election isn\u2019t something to ignore.\n\nReddit often serves as a left-leaning echo chamber, and if you spend enough time here, it\u2019s easy to believe that Harris has the race in the bag. But that\u2019s far from reality. The outcome is not guaranteed, and complacency could be costly.\n\nThe only way to ensure Harris wins is to GET OUT AND VOTE.\n\nDon\u2019t take anything for granted!",

Black voters in North Carolina were told Democrats wanted to take away their menthol cigarettes, while working-class White men in the Midwest were warned that Harris would support quotas for minorities and deny them Zyn nicotine pouches.What voters had no way of knowing at the time was that all of the ads were part of a single $45 million effort created by political advisers to Tesla founder Elon Musk who had previously worked on the presidential campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), according to a presentation about the group\u2019s efforts obtained by The Washington Post.The project, funded with anonymous donations, micro-targeted messages across the battleground states, often with ads that appeared to be something they were not \u2014 a tactic the organizers sometimes referred to internally as \u201cfalse positives.\u201dWith digital spots, direct mail, text messages, influencer marketing and mobile billboards, the overall project was a high-tech experiment in misdirection \u2014 an old political tactic that has been sharpened in recent decades with increasingly precise targeting techniques.Ads tested better if Muslims felt they were seeing a message meant for Zionists, \u201cBernie bros\u201d felt they were hearing from the far left, and \u201cZyn bros\u201d felt they were hearing from activists who wanted \u201ca world without gas-powered vehicles,\u201d a ban on fracking and affordable housing for undocumented Americans \u2014 policies Harris did not actually support during her campaign.\u201cThe worst part is Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth,\u201d said one of the ads, which was designed by Trump supporters to look as if it was advocating for leftist priorities like \u201cfree health care\u201d and a \u201cbreak on tuition.\u201dElon Musk speaks at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in New York on Oct. 27. A group of Musk political advisers funded a $45 million misdirection campaign targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)The entire effort grew out of research by Building America\u2019s Future, a conservative political nonprofit that was founded during the first Trump administration by Republican consultants Generra Peck and Phil Cox. With others at P2 Public Affairs, Peck and Cox, former advisers to DeSantis, were top strategists for a separate effort, America PAC, the super PAC funded by Musk to support Trump. Musk donated to Building America\u2019s Future in 2022, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The group\u2019s leaders have declined to comment on their donors.Starting in February, Ryan Tyson, a former pollster for DeSantis, began holding a series of about 25 focus groups with specific communities of targeted voters, with most of the research effort focused on likely Democrats who were uncertain about voting. The goal was to figure out how to help Donald Trump win during a campaign in which Democrats were vastly outspending Republicans on digital advertising\u2026\u2026.",

            "The Biden Harris Administration was possibly the best administration for the working people since FDR and the first 2 years of the new Trump administration will reap the rewards of all that work done for the working class, then the shit will be like nothing over ever dreamed of. There will be a recession and possibly depression, there will be more people having to take the jobs the immigrant community used to do for less money than they received, the world will be a simple but no longer deeply embedded ally of America and Russian people will have gotten part of the Ukraine they don\u2019t deserve and the war will be mostly a mop up operation by Russia/Korean troops all the while the EU will have fortified and gotten much closer to China. The world will be changed and many people will feel it. But don\u2019t blame the Democrats for doing the best for low and middle income Americans over the past four years. The predecessor wanted people to inject bleach in their arms to cure COVID while sending testing kits to the President of Russia. Just fucking think about that a minute or two!",

Empiracally, provably.  \n\nAre the democrats for the working class?  Debatable, and I personally land on no.\n\nHere's the real problem.  Inflation is a natural part of our economy, and at strong points in our economy, wages go up at the same rate as inflation (not just the average wage, but the minimum wage and the median wage).  \n\nHowever, for the past **50 years**, income has not kept up with inflation.  The past 8 years just happened to be significatnly worse on that front, so we felt more pain in a shorter amount of time.\n\nThe democrats aren't proposing to make that right.  They are proposing to not make it so wrong.  They need to understand the difference.\n\nBecause when the republicans are promising \"vote for us, and you individually will have more money in your pocket\", which is technically true, the voters don't care about your breadcrumbs.",

We need more young people running who know literally anything about politics but aren't politicians. Republicans aren't running politicians. That's not what people want. They want honesty and not to be called stupid or bigoted for disagreeing with us.",

He tells them what they want to hear (all lies and made up logic) and they give him the vote. Critical thinking has taken a back seat in this country.",

The founding fathers very explicitly did not trust the average person, because they thought they wouldn't be civically engaged and thus would be too easily led into mobs if the masses were given too much power.\n\nWhat's changed is how complicated society has become.\n\nLike I know fishermen that voted on a single issue:  off shore wind farms.\n\nHarris wants to build them, which would be disruptive to fishing.  Trump said he doesn't, but in reality he doesn't care.  \n\nYou can say that Trump lied, and that my fishermen friends just lack critical thinking ability, but to blame 80 million people for that I think is problematic.\n\nPeople will always vote for whatever is closest to them.  This is a problem in winner-take-all politics, because people ***have to*** vote with things they don't want to.  Like if someone is a single issue voter between capitalism and socialism, but they want things like equality in marriage or employment opportunity, they have to make a hard choice between the GOP and the Democrats.  And I would say that's a problem beyond Trump, because even without Trump, you're going to have people that vote for the GOP because of their economic beliefs, religious beliefs, or patriotic beliefs, despite not necessarily agreeing with everything on their platform, just because the GOP speaks more to the issues closest to them.\n\nYou say that shows a lack of critical thinking on behalf of the politic.\n\nFine.\n\nIf that's the case, then we really, ***really*** need to change our form of government to compartmentalized our politics away from this winner-take-all system, so that single issue voters can vote their concsious without doing what millions perceive as destroying the country.",

        "Title": "An Economic Reality for Democrats & Republicans",
        "Text": "Bernie Sanders released a statement yesterday following the election results that could not have been more accurate. The Democrat party have completely turned their backs on working families.  As 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, the DNC, Biden, and Kamala have continuously said the economy said was strong and healthy.\n\n  \nInflation & the economy were top issues in this presidential cycle for independent voters, which indicates their displeasure for the current estate of affairs. If inflation was low and the economy were strong, it wouldn't have been an issue. This led to hundreds of thousands of voters to cast their vote for Donald Trump, who has swayed them with his hopes and promises.\n\nThe reality is, Trump will not make this economy stronger in 4 years, it will be WEAKER. Trump's tax cuts will create a bigger deficit in our budget, along with the continuation of foreign aid to Israel. Harris would not have made this economy stronger either. This current economy is not solely the blame of Biden, its been a continuation of wasteful military spending and other reckless spending beginning with George W. Bush, now being passed back to Trump. The US has been lucky to not have been in a complete recession since then, simply the can is being kicked down the road. And the continuation of bank bailouts and corporate leaders in bed with the government will only make us WEAKER.\n\n  \nIf you are are Trump supporter, you need to recognize that Trump cannot fix this economy with his current plan. He wants to cut interest rates,  lower taxes, and maintain government spending, this is QE and inflationary.\n\n  \nIf you are a Harris supporter, you need to recognize that in certain places of our country currently people pay more in taxes than they do Norway, Sweden, Finland etc. Why is it that we pay more in taxes and do not have free education, healthcare, homeless programs like our friends in Europe? Hint: It's the government's mismanagement of funds.\n\n  \nI don't predict the US will have a better economy in the foreseeable future, it will have to create a Great Depression for any change to occur, because their needs to be DRASTIC change.\n\n  \nWhether you are friends of the RNC or DNC, federal government spending and management is a total disaster. If we want to be like our friends in Europe, we need leave the Federal Government with responsibility of the military, and allow State & Local governments more power to assist the people in need of their jurisdiction. \n\n  \nGovernment programs such as Trump's PPP loans, FEMA, student loans are part of the problem. If we simply got rid of our federal government student loan programs, tuition would drastically be less, if our tax money went to state & local governments and people want free education in their state, they should be able to vote and keep their local politicians accountable.\n\nDC cannot possibly be knowledgeable for the needs of people in Hawaii, Alaska, or Florida, however the local governments who are on the ground are. The problem with the US is the Federal government's lousy job in thinking they know what's right for its people, and wasteful spending on things the people did not ask for.\n\n  \nSo if you voted for Trump or Harris, our economy will be much more worse in 4 years than it is now. The stock market sky rocketing because of a Trump win yesterday, tells me people still don't get it.\n\n\n\n ",

        "Text": "With the U.S. election coming up, it\u2019s worth understanding the positions of each candidate on issues impacting Palestine. While both candidates have taken different stances, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump approach the Israel-Palestine conflict with noticeably different priorities.\n\nDonald Trump has consistently demonstrated strong support for Israel, especially through actions and statements since October. \n\n* [Recently, he proposed new policies that include barring entry to individuals from areas he considers \u201csecurity threats,\u201d **including Gaza**, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-vows-expand-travel-ban-gaza-rcna120711)\n* He [also announced intentions to send deportation officers to U.S. protests he deems \u201cpro-Hamas,](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/trumps-plan-quell-protests-deport-hamas-radicals-rcna166168)\u201d a term that\u2019s broad and could easily be applied to many forms of Palestine support.\n\n* In an interview with Fox News, Trump said, \u201c[We need to protect Israel. There is no choice](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6338927770112),\u201d signaling a lack of openness to calls for de-escalation. \n\n* [The Trump Administration deviated from a 1978 State Department legal opinion that held Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are \u201cinconsistent with international law.\u201d](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-ap-top-news-international-news-politics-west-bank-3da4fb3671004679a91a7d4ae9ab4e57\\))\n\n* [The Trump Administration cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees \\(UNRWA\\)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-administration-cuts-funding-united-nations-palestinian-refugee-agency-n905616\\))\n\n* He said \"[Actually, Israel is the one \\(that wants to keep going\\), and you should let them go and let them finish the job. He \\(Biden\\) doesn\u2019t want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian. He's a weak one.\u201d]\n(https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-criticized-palestinian-insult-debate-with-biden-2024-06-28/)\n\n* [He said : \"He\u2019s doing a good job,\u201d Trump said about the Israeli leader. \u201cBiden is trying to hold him back, just so you understand, Biden is more superior to the V.P. He\u2019s trying to hold him back, and he probably should be doing the opposite, actually. I\u2019m glad that \\[Netanyahu\\] decided to do what he had to do, but it\u2019s moving along pretty good\"](https://newrepublic.com/post/187332/trump-biden-tough-netanyahu)\n\n* He has continued to highlight his past actions, like [moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights) and [recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706588932/trump-formally-recognizes-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights). \n\n* [Trump told Netanyahu to \"Do what you have to do\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/trump-netanyahu-support-gaza-lebanon/)\n\n* [Trump stated that the U.S. should let the conflict \u201cplay out.\u201d\n](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4304401-trump-israel-hamas-war-let-things-play-out/)\n\n**His policies underline his clear alignment with Israeli interests.**\n\n\nKamala Harris, who is now leading the Democratic ticket after Biden stepped down, has taken a different approach. \n\n* [ She has called for peace and an immediate ceasefire, emphasizing protection and dignity for Palestinians, and added that \"what has happened in Gaza in the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking\"](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc).\n\n* [She was against the Israeli invasion of Rafah](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-rafah-gaza-tiktok.html\\))  \n\n* While she hasn\u2019t suggested specific policies like defunding Israel, she has spoken more[ broadly and extensively about the need for de-escalation and security for civilians in the region](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1234822836/kamala-harris-benny-gantz-gaza-cease-fire-israel-hamas).\n\nAs the campaign progresses, **Harris may be limited by the demands of a close race, but her emphasis on dialogue and restraint stands in contrast to Trump\u2019s** more unilateral support for Israel. For those watching the U.S. election with Palestine in mind, these are key points to consider.\n\nAs the race is expected to be close, with Trump leading in many polls, **keep in mind that a vote for a third-party candidate would likely have the effect of boosting Trump's chances.**\n\n**Much of this information and more straight facts on the candidates positions on Israel/Gaza can be found on [this page created by the Arab American Institute](https://www.aaiusa.org/president-issues/kamala-harris-on-palestine)**",

He has said he'll use the US military against people in the United States, the 'enemy within.'\n\nTrump would have made friends with Hitler and the US would have been on the wrong side of history.

The upper middle class would rather align with billionaires than the actual working class because they aspire to join that elite group.\n\nAs an immigrant and working-class person of color, I can't relate to your ideals at all. Trying to scare me with Trump? That won't work. I despise him just as much as I despise Harris. Living under Trump wasn\u2019t worse for me than living under Biden. Our children are still in cages. We still have no healthcare, no education, no immigration reform, no labor protections. My taxes are being used to build COP-CITIES around the country, and murder children in Gaza and Lebanon and invade countries that have done nothing to us.\n\nIt\u2019s laughable that you think Trump would have befriended Hitler. The U.S. *was* friends with Hitler and European fascists\u2014until they couldn\u2019t be. And with some, like Franco, they remained allies, supporting his reign of terror until the '70s!\n\nBut that\u2019s the past. Today, Biden and Harris are best buddies with Netanyahu and fully support genocide. In fact, the actual fascist Italian Prime Minister Meloni has a better position toward genocidal Israel than the U.S. does. The U.S. is on the wrong side of history, *right now*.\n\nI see no difference between Trump and Biden.

At that time if he lost against Hillary Clinton I think he would have ran again but I don't think it would of been in any way the fever pitch national chaos in the way he did in 2020.\n\nThis is now being fully telegraphed and it started (well, it started in 2020) during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris.\n\nPrior to the debate, Nick Fuentes came out with a tweet in response to a report that Donald Trump admitted to losing the election by a whisker. No, I am not making it up that he said, \"I lost by a whisker\". You can't make this stuff up.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-acknowledges-lost-2020-election-whisker-rcna169526)\n\nWhat Nick said in the tweet was this amongst other supporters being enraged.\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/trump-admits-lost-2020-enrages-supporters/75086053007/)\n\n[https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html](https://www.aol.com/trump-admits-lost-2020-leading-192730265.html)\n\n**Here is Nick's quote.**\n\n>\"So, why did we do Stop the Steal? Why did anyone go to Jan. 6? Why did any one go to jail? ... It would have been good to know that before 1,600 people got charged,\" Fuentes said\u00a0**on his podcast**, referring to the criminal charges for those who invaded and ransacked the Capitol. \"It would\u2019ve been good to know that before I had all my money frozen, put on a no-fly list, banned from everything, lost all my bank and payment processing.\u201d\n\nNow, besides Nick being a white supremacist amongst other things I have to agree with the sentiment. It's pretty reasonable regardless of who it came from.\n\nThe weird part is what nobody was talking about in relation to the Harris / Trump debate. When ABC moderators asked Trump if he lost the election Trump went completely against the Lex Fridman interview and effectively retracted that he ever admitted to losing. I guess people were too busy laughing it up regarding Trump's gaffe regarding immigrants eating dogs and cats.\n\nTo me, this is a distraction to what is literally happening before our eyes. White supremacists are using Trump to start a civil war; AND, Trump is going right along with it.\n\nIf someone told Trump that he better follow along then there is no clearer example of the 72 hours or so that Trump went to admitting to a complete retraction. What's more odd is how fast Trump reversed and climbed right back into the racist and the worst of us political base.\n\nIt's as if Trump was willing to be \"more normal\" candidate when he was clearly in the winning category of the upcoming election. However, when it was becoming clear he was losing it's as if every guardrail has come off. He has fully surrounded himself with an absolute horrible person in Laura Loomer. She has gone so far as to not only suggest immigrants are eating pets via cats and dogs but also humans.\n\nMoreover, there has been bomb threats and now a deployment of Proud Boys descending on SpringField Ohio for the purpose of? WTF knows.\n\nWith all of this obviousness being thrown directly into our faces the Media is literally standing there and acting like everything is normal. It is so crazy, it is as if Trump is willing and ready to start January 6th again but right now. I don't even know if we will make it to the the election before something \"bad\" happens.\n\nAt what point is the media and Republican donors going to pull the rug and say this is absolutely not acceptable? Why is the media literally acting like this is even remotely normal.\n\nMy god, are we going to even make it to the election? I don't actually know at this point.",

Lee's lie was spread by Trump to 65 million during the debate and Vance and Loomer are also spreading Lee's lie and adding on to it. As a consequence, children's schools had to be closed as did hospitals. The KKK has arrived too, as criminal opportunists. This woman's lie has set an entire town on fire figuratively. There are those who deceive and those who choose to be deceived. For all others there are those who have knowledge, wisdom and understanding and who reject the lies.

In the meantime, if I\u2019m advising her, I say, \u2018Just keep doing this, it\u2019s working,\u2019\u201d Bream added. \n\n\u201cYou have an adoring media, you have people who are not pressing you on what appear to be changes in positions and those kinds of things. It may be the debate is the first time that they get to that.\n\n\u201cBut in the meantime, I wouldn\u2019t change anything if I was her. It\u2019s working,\u201d Bream said. \u201cHer unfavorables are down, her favorables are up 12 points just since she has been named to the ticket. So why change it if it\u2019s working?\u201d",

            ">\u201cThis is what you would call a public nervous breakdown,\u201d Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and onetime Trump administration official, told Politico. \u201cThis is a guy who cut through the Republican primary like a knife through butter. This is a guy who pummeled a semiconscious president in a debate and literally out of a race. And now this is a guy who cannot come to grips with a competitive presidential race that would require discipline and effective messaging. And we\u2019re seeing a candidate and a campaign absolutely melt down.\u201d As a reminder, last week Trump appeared before the National Association of Black Journalists and told members that the VP, who attended a historically Black college, was only Indian until a few years ago. He presumably thought this would help him with Black voters, but it only demonstrated what many people have long known: that he\u2019s not very bright and doesn\u2019t know how race works.\n\n>All of this is leaving Republicans hoping that the ex-president will realize the error of his ways and get his shit together. And considering that would effectively require him to receive a personality transplant overnight, not everyone is convinced it\u2019s possible.",

            "When I refereed to Fascism, I was referring to the money people who would be controlling the lawmakers.\n\nTrump has not a civic bone in his body. His mission in taking the presidency, was to help the money interests, his interests, and he knew enough to get the big money to back him.\n\nIf he wins this time, they win. If he loses this time, they have to sit and wait again for the right candidate, left or right, to come along.\n\nI not only think we are in end stage capitalism, I think it will be combined with severe economic collapse partly because of global warming. We will be ripe for Fascism.\n\nThe big food corporations are buying up the empty sky scrapers and turning them into vertical gardens. I suspect, they see major crop losses in the future. It just is not economical to grow indoors at scale. It is very economical if it is the best or only game in town.\n\nI also see the ultra rich buying up old mines and turning them into self contained living space with independent water and electric supply, indoor grow spaces, and living quarters for the select few and the workers.\n\nOf course, they can just be doing is for a host of reasons but I suspect they see global warming as a major issue.\n\nThis ball we call earth is about 1,800 miles in diameter. That is a lot of mass and we have been heating it now for a couple of hundred years. I will bet the results of our efforts lag the input by 20 to 50 years. So when we stop burning oil, the place will continue to heat up for a good long while.\n\nI also doubt we will stop until we actually feel the pain.\n\nAny or all of those possibilities would change our politics into something we would not recognize today.\n\nI am now 73 so for me, it is more about just watching it and trying to make it better where I can.\n\nIn 2012, I stopped all row crops on this 40 acre farm and began planting wildflowers and trees. Nature helps with the soft woods, Cotton woods, Maples, Ems and bushes. Maybe 100,000 trees or so and I have planted several thousand assorted nuts, acorns, walnuts, hickory nuts and such. Those first trees are now like 10 feet tall.\n\nWe have a lake here set in the middle towards the back. 6 acres  in size, 22 feet deep, and well stocked with fish that we own. At any given moment, there are around 20 tons of living fish in there. If I can get this farm shaded over by roughly 2034 or so, I can keep the summertime temperature here, 20 degrees cooler than in town on a hot summer day. If I succeed, I may be adding 20 to 50 years to that body of water. That is roughly half a trillion gallons.\n\nThis started out as merely an idea to make a safe zone for nature here. We've now gained roughly 35 deer and 75 turkeys that live here full time now. I soon enough realized it might be our safe zone as well.\n\nThen because I've known what a shit bag he was since the 70's, I go against him at every chance."

            "For Hillary Clinton, it could be written off as trying to differentiate between her and former president Bill Clinton, since they share a last name. Now that it's VP Harris, I'm pretty sure it's a lack of respect, conscious or otherwise.",
            "I think the answer is mixed. Partly disrespect & delegitimizing a female candidate & partly embracing the nonsense. \n\nBeing southern my knee-jerk response to someone calling the VP \"Kamala\" is: who do you think you are? You know her like that? Not particularly because I just want to chastise people. But, taking women office holders in my state, had pundits or news anchors called the former governor \"Kathleen\" instead of Governor Babineaux-Blanco or the former senator simply \"Mary\" instead of Senator Landrieu every listener/reader would have intuitively known what was being implied by that (that the person being spoken of doesn't deserve respect). Honestly I'm speaking primarily as a southerner here who's etiquette is filtered through the social norms of where I am from, which I feel is probably a bit different than other regions of the country. \n\n\nOn the other hand we saw an embracing of the branding by HRC, and I feel like I'm seeing it with VP Harris too. It seems like flipping the script and embracing what you're being called already. Also the whole first name basis branding works to make candidates more relatable as well. I think that women presidential candidates are certainly trying to navigate uncharted waters to break the glass ceiling & relatability is something to embrace. As a voter I'm happy to embrace whatever naming convention a person chooses & it doesn't feel disrespectful when it's embraced by them. \n\n\n*I feel like this is a hot mess of a comment on a messy complex topic, hopefully it actually makes sense outside of my own reading* \ud83d\ude02",

            "I think you're probably right. It did strike me as strange to see her referred to by her first name, but with those examples it's not so weird.",
            "It\u2019s also how she brands her campaign, to make it more memorable. Same reason HRC brands herself as Hilary in her election. \n\nI mean, AOC gets called AOC, and not just Alexandria"

            "Hey listen. \n\nI'm an utterly HUGE fan of Joe Biden's performance as President, and I tremendously admire his dignity and his results. \n\nI also have lived through both aging grandparents and aging parents.\n\n*There comes a time when a person is affected by their age too much to both look like they can do the job... and have the ability to* **do the job**.\n\nI saw Joe Biden pass that point during the Trump/Biden debate. \n\n===================================================\n\nI did not see the debate's start, due to having to handle an issue with (yup) an aging parent that required a calming phone call.\n\nSo I joined the debate a few minutes in, at a point where Trump was answering a question redirected after Biden had (let's be honest) weakly answered it in the manner of an infirm person. While Trump lied and ranted and didn't actually answer the question, *Biden looked down and concentrated closely on slowly drawing a line across his notes.* \n\nI've seen this before. I've seen where elderly people, who are struggling with over-stimulation or other forms of in-the-moment cognitive failure, focus narrowly on a single thing they can do. I saw Joe Biden shut down.\n\nA President cannot afford to appear like this. They simply cannot.\n\n\"Oh Jesus Christ\", I said to myself with utter horror. \"Biden's going to lose the debate. The single most important exercise for him at this time, the one that will either make or break public confidence in him.... and he's blowing it.\"\n\nAnd then, a couple minutes later, I turned it off as I knew the press would be all over it the next day. Even before Biden got sucked into talking about golf skills, for fucks sake.\n\n==================================================\n\nOP, it's not **just** georontophobia and age bigotry that's doing this. Those absolutely are factors that are being leveraged by enemies of both the Democratic party and of democracy itself. They contribute.\n\nBut Joe Biden appeared to fail in those crucial moments due to his age, **not because of age bigotry, but because his age had caught up with him**.\n\nAnd in that case, and in my own experience, it will get worse over the ensuing weeks and the four years of the Presidency, and there would have been follow-up events that reinforced that picture of him, and ensured he could not win the election even if he squeaked by after that debate performance. \n\nAnd that would have been enough to destroy Democracy in America if allowed to progress through to the election.\n\nTHAT is why Kamala Harris is the Democratic candidate. \n\nNot \"gerontophobia\" or \"age bigotry\".",
            "It\u2019s not about Biden\u2019s age, it\u2019s about the perception of his current state of physical and mental health. If he had appeared to actually be in reasonably good health at the debate and following interviews nobody would blink an eye at his actual age. When Sanders ran against Biden, he was also in that age bracket but that didn\u2019t come up much or at all because he appeared to be in good health. And when Biden delivered the State of the Union he, again, appeared in good health so worries about him diminished for a while. But in the last couple of months Biden\u2019s apparent health and perceived mental state have not looked good, frankly, and that\u2019s what ultimately led to all the pressure for him to drop out. \n\nSo while there are some people who are ageist and just don\u2019t want \u201canybody over 65 to run\u201d, etc, that\u2019s not the driving force behind Biden\u2019s retirement. He just realized that, whether he thinks he is or not, a lot of people who have watched him speaking recently are coming away with the impression that something is physically wrong. And I\u2019m saying that as someone who likes Biden overall.",
            "I would agree that it was age bigotry before the debate. \n\nAfter the debate, it was a serious and realistic acknowledgment that Joe Biden was not capable of leading the country. \n\nWe can all absolutely agree that Donald Trump is in no way capable of leading the country. However, we also know that there is no condition in which Trump will be asked to step down. If he answered every question with \"covfefe I'm a rapist\", Republicans would cheer and holler and pound their chests proudly.\n\nThere was no performance Trump could give it that debate that would disqualify him in the eyes of Republicans. \n\nHowever, Democrats do have some standards. And more importantly, Independents and swing state voters have standards. It was clear after the debate that neither candidate could meet the standards of independent and swing state voters. And that was an important standard for Biden to meet. \n\nThis is one instance where Democrats should be very proud that leadership put party (and America) over ego.",
            "I have written to the AARP asking why they have remained silent on many recent issues including the Republicans plan to cut social security and medicare and, of course, the intentional and rampant age-discrimination. They have never responded. To that end, when my subscription with them runs out, screw 'em.\n\nPS: You can still get the AARP \"discount\" at hotels and elsewhere, just ask for it.",
            "I just turned 79 and had a very responsible job while working.   I am in good health but there is no way that at any age over 70, a human can be as sharp or active as they were less than 70.    We cannot put the United States Government in the hands of someone that is too old to respond to the requirements of the job.   That is committing mass suicide.   Kamala Harris is of the proper age to compete for this responsible of a job.   Trump and Biden and their Depends were never the answer.",
            "Clearly **many** concern-trolls are bothered by it, so there's that...",
            "Because it\u2019s also based on hands on experience in the WH and competence.",
            "Those of us with stutters, will often have our brains run faster than our mouths and lose our train of thought while our mouths race to catch up. Often that means verbalizing what's in our brains even though we don't intend to. And, if we can't catch up, we go back to what we best remember. Usually we can get back to order within a few minutes and carry on from there.\n\nAnd in the same way we have allowed age discrimination to go unchallenged, not a single news commentator or medical professional has ever explained that to the American people.\n\nI have full trust in Joe Biden's ability to be our President.",
            "Much of what you wrote made sense, but I think you made one crucial error, which I respectfully would change if I might :\n\nYour last sentence should read, I think,\n\n\"Not *only* gerontophobia or age bigotry.\"\n\nAnd I state this because I have read some of the tweets (now X, yes, I know) and posts and press releases made by some of the Democrats towards Joe Biden, and some of them are unquestionably gerontophobic.   To deny that there were such posts is disrespectful against every human being who someday lives past the age of 60.",
            "I hope the optimism of your thoughts here is correct.   I like how you put it.",
            "Nearly everything you write makes sense, and I thank you for presenting it so clearly and cogently.\n\nMy one concern is that whatever pride Democrats may feel for Joe Biden's willingness to step down\n\nshould be mitigated by shame and apology for the nastiness with which some people urged him to step down\n\nand the outright bullying tactics used by some of the donors to coerce him into stepping down.\n\nRepublicans may be fine with bullying, but Democrats should not be.\n\nBiden may be owed respect and praise for his stepping down, but he is also owed apologies."

            "*The first is that Biden did step aside, but it took a grueling, uncertain, painful month. The party is exhausted. It is tired of its internal drama. It wants to turn its attention back on Trump.*\n\nIt was all media driven and both the NY Times and the Washington Post are responsible for bringing a President down for the clicks.\n\n*\"Harris\u2019s reputation was as a candidate with the tangibles but not the intangibles. She was great on paper but, in 2020, couldn\u2019t put the pieces together. I remember watching her campaign announcement speech and finding it hollow. It was built around clich\u00e9 refrains \u2014 \u201cfor the people,\u201d \u201clet\u2019s speak truth\u201d \u2014 but there was no core to it.\"*\n\nYup. And she's already - again - repeating Hillary's mistakes.\n\n*\"The Biden administration\u2019s record is unpopular, and she cannot make a clean break from it. Immediately uniting around Harris feels safe to some Democrats. To other Democrats, it\u2019s risky. They risk making the mistake they made with Biden, which is being so afraid of disunity that they\u2019re failing to gather the information they need to know how their candidate will really perform.\"*\n\nThat is, if you get your news from the news. If you look around the nation is in fine shape. And, if you press MAGA on specific issues like, 'do you know anyone who is looking for work and can't find it?\" or, \"Is your company laying people off\"? You get a clearer picture of Bidenomics. But the press refuses to do so because specificity does not generate clicks.\n\n\"Let a few up-and-comers make their case against Donald Trump. Let\u2019s see some CNN town halls, some multicandidate forums. Nobody is going to go negative on each other here. Give the country a reason to watch a lineup of young Democrats, most of all Harris, make their cases against Trump day after day for the next few weeks.\"\n\nWhy go through all that effort when media coverage will consist of, \"Harris Debates Dissatisfied Democrats\" or \"Democratic Upstarts Vying Against Harris Weakening Her In the Polls\" or some other such nonsense."
